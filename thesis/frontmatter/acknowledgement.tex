This work would not have been possible, or at the very least far less enjoyable, without the help and support of my supervisors, colleagues, friends and family. 

First, I would like to thank my thesis committee members, Dr. David Alexander and Dr. Maarten V. de Hoop for agreeing to serve on my committee and reading a first draft of this work. I would especially like to thank Dr. Alexander for his advice and guidance, both career- and research-related, during my time as a graduate student and for helping me navigate the field of solar physics.

During my brief time in the solar physics community, I have been fortunate to collaborate with several talented and accomplished researchers. I am extremely grateful to Professor Peter Cargill (Imperial College London, University of St Andrews) for sharing his unparalleled knowledge of coronal loop physics and for his patience in guiding me through the writing and publication of two papers early in my graduate career, the first of which comprises \autoref{ch:inferring_hot_plasma} of this thesis. Additionally, I would like to thank Dr. Nicholeen Viall (NASA Goddard Space Flight Center) for providing her observational expertise, detailed knowledge of the temperature sensitivity of the AIA passbands, and for providing helpful comments and revisions on \autoref{ch:modeling-observables} of this thesis.

I owe a special debt of gratitude to my undergraduate research advisor, Dr. Lorin Matthews (Baylor University), for teaching me about the microphysics of dust grains and inspiring me to go to graduate school. I am grateful for her patience and kindness as a mentor early in my physics education.

I would also like to thank past and present members of the Rice solar research group including Shah Bahauddin, Reva Mandage, and Jeffrey Reep. A special debt of gratitude goes to Brandon Mueller for helping me survive the first two years of graduate school and for securing us an office with a window.

Additionally, I am very grateful to many others at Rice and in Houston for making my time as a graduate student all the more enjoyable. Many thanks go to Dan, Kong, Joe, Nathan, Loah, Laura, Alison, and Alex for hearing my complaints at lunch, sharing more than a few beers at Valhalla, and making graduate school bearable and, on occasion, fun. I would especially like to thank Joe and Mitch for their friendship and support both in Waco and in Houston and for many a cathartic game of Smash Bros.

I would like to thank my parents, Mark and Terri, for their love and financial, emotional, and physical support throughout my entire life, across multiple states and a few continents. I would also like to thank my siblings, Jessie and Wesley, for always being willing to remind me that I am not that smart. I owe special thanks to my in-laws, Jim and Susan, as well as to my siblings-in-law, Tara and Michael, for the many rounds of disc golf and even more free meals; and Tamara and Mike for making me feel welcome when I first moved to Houston and for continuing to support me as I prepare to leave.

Lastly and most importantly, I am forever grateful to my wife, Morgan, to whom this thesis is dedicated. Her ever-present optimism, constant encouragement, and unmatched love of dogs have made life all the more enjoyable, even in the face of looming thesis submission deadlines. Without her unconditional love and support, I would not have made it to graduate school let alone finished this thesis.
