  abstract = {The recent analysis of observations taken with the EUV Imaging Spectrometer and X-Ray Telescope instruments on Hinode suggests that well-constrained measurements of the temperature distribution in solar active regions can finally be made. Such measurements are critical for constraining theories of coronal heating. Past analysis, however, has suffered from limited sample sizes and large uncertainties at temperatures between 5 and 10~MK. Here we present a systematic study of the differential emission measure distribution in 15 active region cores. We focus on measurements in the inter-moss region, that is, the region between the loop footpoints, where the observations are easier to interpret. To reduce the uncertainties at the highest temperatures we present a new method for isolating the Fe XVIII emission in the AIA/SDO 94 \AA{} channel. The resulting differential emission measure distributions confirm our previous analysis showing that the temperature distribution in an active region core is often strongly peaked near 4~MK. We characterize the properties of the emission distribution as a function of the total unsigned magnetic flux. We find that the amount of high-temperature emission in the active region core is correlated with the total unsigned magnetic flux, while the emission at lower temperatures, in contrast, is inversely related. These results provide compelling evidence that high-temperature active region emission is often close to equilibrium, although weaker active regions may be dominated by evolving million degree loops in the core.},

  abstract = {Despite significant progress in understanding the dynamics of the corona, there remain several unanswered questions about the basic physical properties of coronal loops. Recent observations from different instruments have yielded contradictory results about some
characteristics of coronal loops, specifically as to whether the observed loops are spatially resolved. In this paper, we examine the evolution of coronal loops through two extreme-ultraviolet filters and determine if they evolve as a single cooling strand. We measure the temporal evolution of eight active region loops previously studied and found to be isothermal and resolved by Aschwanden \& Nightingale. All eight loops appear in "hotter" TRACE filter images (Fe XII 195 \AA{}) before appearing in the "cooler" (Fe IX/Fe X 171 \AA{}) TRACE filter images. We use the measured delay between the two filters to calculate a cooling time and then determine if that cooling time is consistent with the observed lifetime of the loop. We do this twice: once when the loop appears (rise phase) and once when it disappears (decay phase). We find that only one loop appears consistent with a single cooling strand and hence could be considered to be resolved by TRACE. For the remaining seven loops, their observed lifetimes are longer than expected for a single cooling strand. We suggest that these loops could be formed of multiple cooling strands, each at a different temperature. These findings indicate that the majority of loops observed by TRACE are unresolved.},

  abstract = {The coronal heating mechanism for active region core loops is difficult to determine because these loops are often not resolved and cannot be studied individually. Rather, we concentrate on the "inter-moss" areas between loop footpoints. We use observations from the Hinode EUV Imaging Spectrometer and the X-Ray Telescope to calculate the emission measure distributions of eight inter-moss areas in five different active regions. The combined data sets provide both high- and low-temperature constraints and ensure complete coverage in the temperature range appropriate for active regions. For AR 11113, the emission can be modeled with heating events that occur on timescales less than the cooling time. The loops in the core regions appear to be close to equilibrium and are consistent with steady heating. The other regions studied, however, appear to be dominated by nanoflare heating. Our results are consistent with the idea that active region age is an important parameter in determining whether steady or nanoflare heating is primarily responsible for the core emission, that is, older regions are more likely to be dominated by steady heating, while younger regions show more evidence of nanoflares.},

the Solar Dynamics Observatory. Using the best parameters of the previous work as the input of the present one, we find that the
amplitude of the random fluctuations driven by the random heat pulses increases from the bottom to the top of the loop in the 94 \AA{}
channel and from the top to the bottom in the 335 \AA{} channel. This prediction is confirmed by the observation of a set of aligned
neighboring pixels along a bright arc of an active region core. Maps of pixel fluctuations may therefore provide easy diagnostics of nanoflaring regions.},

emission measure distributions based on a Metropolis Markov-chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC[M]) method. This technique allows us to (1) relax
nonphysical smoothness constraints generally imposed on DEMs, (2)
determine confidence bounds on the computed values, and (3) include
extra information in the form of upper limits. Using the MCMC[M]
algorithm, we reanalyze extreme ultraviolet spectral line fluxes
obtained from Solar Extreme Ultraviolet Rocket Telescope and
Spectrograph observations by Brosius et al. to obtain differential
emission measure (DEM) distributions for active and quiet regions on the
Sun. Both active- and quiet-region DEMs show a probable minimum near log
T \textasciitilde{} 5.6; the quiet-region DEM drops off beyond log T = 6.4, while the
active-region DEM does not show evidence of a significant downturn even
at log T = 7. The most striking aspect of our results is that the latter
also shows several sharp peaks (of width \textasciitilde{}0.1 dex), notably at log T = 6
and 6.3, and a broad feature, beyond log T = 6.5. We also explore the
limitations on DEM reconstruction imposed by imperfect atomic data,
choice of spectral lines, uncertainties in abundances, and other
systematic errors. Within these limitations, we discuss the derived
emission measure distribution and comment on its implications to coronal
structure. We conclude that calculation of uncertainties on the DEM are
crucial in the interpretation of structure seen in reconstructions.
Further, a careful selection of the spectral lines used to infer the DEM
is needed in order to avoid ``artificially'' generating structure in the
DEM.},

  doi = {10.1051/0004-6361/200810735},
  abstract = {Context: The effects of non-equilibrium processes on the ionisation 
state of strongly emitting elements in the solar corona can be extremely
difficult to assess and yet they are critically important. For example,
there is much interest in dynamic heating events localised in the solar
corona because they are believed to be responsible for its high
temperature and yet recent work has shown that the hottest
($\geq$107 K) emission predicted to be associated with these
events can be observationally elusive due to the difficulty of creating
the highly ionised states from which the expected emission arises. This
leads to the possibility of observing instruments missing such heating
events entirely. Aims: The equations describing the evolution of
the ionisaton state are a very stiff system of coupled, partial
differential equations whose solution can be numerically challenging and
time-consuming. Without access to specialised codes and significant
computational resources it is extremely difficult to avoid the
assumption of an equilibrium ionisation state even when it clearly
cannot be justified. The aim of the current work is to develop a
computational tool to allow straightforward calculation of the
time-dependent ionisation state for a wide variety of physical
circumstances. Methods: A numerical model comprising the system
of time-dependent ionisation equations for a particular element and
tabulated values of plasma temperature as a function of time is
developed. The tabulated values can be the solutions of an analytical
model, the output from a numerical code or a set of observational
measurements. An efficient numerical method to solve the ionisation
equations is implemented. Results: A suite of tests is designed
and run to demonstrate that the code provides reliable and accurate
solutions for a number of scenarios including equilibration of the ion
population and rapid heating followed by thermal conductive cooling. It
is found that the solver can evolve the ionisation state to recover
exactly the equilibrium state found by an independent, steady-state
solver for all temperatures, resolve the extremely small
ionisation/recombination timescales associated with rapid temperature
changes at high densities, and provide stable and accurate solutions for
both dominant and minor ion population fractions. Rapid heating and
cooling of low to moderate density plasma is characterised by
significant non-equilibrium ionisation conditions. The effective
ionisation temperatures are significantly lower than the electron
temperature and the values found are in close agreement with the
previous work of others. At the very highest densities included in the
present study an assumption of equilibrium ionisation is found to be
robust. Conclusions: The computational tool presented here
provides a straightforward and reliable way to calculate ionisation
states for a wide variety of physical circumstances. The numerical code
gives results that are accurate and consistent with previous studies,
has relatively undemanding computational requirements and is freely

predicting the spectrum that would be emitted by such a plasma. The

After a brief historical overview, the review is divided into two separate but not independent parts: the first illustrates the observational framework, the second reviews the theoretical knowledge. Quiescent loops and their confined plasma are considered, and therefore topics such as loop oscillations and flaring loops (except for non-solar ones which provide information on stellar loops) are not specifically addressed here. The observational section discusses loop classification and populations, and then describes the morphology of coronal loops, its relationship with the magnetic field, and the concept of loops as multi-stranded
structures. The following part of this section is devoted to the characteristics of the loop plasma and of its thermal structure in particular, according to the classification into hot, warm, and cool loops. Then, temporal analyses of loops and the observations of plasma dynamics and flows are illustrated. In the modeling section some basics of loop physics are provided, supplying some fundamental scaling laws and timescales, a useful tool for consultation. The concept of loop modeling is introduced and models are distinguished between those treating loops as monolithic and static, and those resolving loops into thin and dynamic strands. Then, more specific discussions address modeling the loop fine structure and the plasma flowing along the loops. Special attention is devoted to the question of loop heating, with separate discussion of wave (AC) and impulsive (DC) heating. Finally, a brief discussion about stellar X-ray emitting structures related to coronal loops is included and followed by conclusions and open
questions.},

We develop new models for this parameter that now include gravitational stratification and a physically motivated approach to radiative cooling. A number of examples are presented, including nanoflares in short and long loops, and a small flare. The new features in EBTEL are important for accurate tracking of, in particular, the density. The 0D results are compared to a 1D hydro code (Hydrad) with generally good agreement. EBTEL is suitable for general use as a tool for (1) quick-look results of loop evolution in response to a given heating function, (2) extensive parameter surveys, and (3) situations where the modeling of hundreds or thousands of elemental loops is needed.

  abstract = {The EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on Hinode will observe solar corona and upper transition region emission lines in the wavelength ranges 170 - 210 \AA{} and 250 - 290 \AA. The line centroid positions and
profile widths will allow plasma velocities and turbulent or non-thermal line broadenings to be measured. We will derive local plasma
temperatures and densities from the line intensities. The spectra will allow accurate determination of differential emission measure and element abundances within a variety of corona and transition region structures. These powerful spectroscopic diagnostics will allow
identification and characterization of magnetic reconnection and wave propagation processes in the upper solar atmosphere. We will also directly study the detailed evolution and heating of coronal loops. The EIS instrument incorporates a unique two element, normal incidence design. The optics are coated with optimized multilayer coatings. We have selected highly efficient, backside-illuminated, thinned CCDs. These design features result in an instrument that has significantly greater effective area than previous orbiting EUV spectrographs with typical active region 2 - 5 s exposure times in the brightest lines. EIS can scan a field of 6\texttimes{}8.5 arc min with spatial and velocity scales of 1 arc sec and 25 km s-1 per pixel. The instrument
design, its absolute calibration, and performance are described in detail in this paper. EIS will be used along with the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) and the X-ray Telescope (XRT) for a wide range of studies of the solar atmosphere.},

  abstract = {We present a method for simulating coronal emissions from solar active regions using observed photospheric magnetograms and an assumption about the coronal heating mechanism as input. The method invokes a "quasi-force-free" (minimized Lorentz force) coronal magnetic solution and a steady state energy balance model solved along field lines. Coronal heating is included using parameterized approximations relating the heat deposited to properties of the magnetic field. We use calculated temperatures and densities to predict emissions and compare to observations from the Yohkoh Soft X-ray satellite. We use NOAA active region 8210 to test the model's sensitivities. We find predicted intensities and emission morphologies change little with different assumptions for the coronal magnetic field. We test methods for calculating the proportionality constant in a heating scale relationship and find filling factors of (1\textendash{}5) \texttimes{} 10 -2 are needed to match temperature in the cases considered. We investigate the effect of heating scale height, finding that loop-top heating improves temperature predictions but decreases success of the emission morphology prediction. Footpoint heating has the opposite effect. Overall, our model produces relatively robust results for a wide range of assumptions. Yet the results are highly sensitive to the input coronal heating parameterization, making our method a powerful approach for discriminating between heating mechanisms. Nevertheless, we find substantial discrepancies between our synthetic emissions and observed emissions. We investigate sources of discrepancy and suggest that improved magnetic field extrapolations and dynamic heating are necessary to improve simulations.},

A line dipole model is used to represent the loop magnetic field, and the variations in loop cross section observed in X-ray photographs are parameterized by the ratio between the cross-sectional areas at the loop apex and base. The results of numerical modeling indicate that for an area ratio greater than unity, increases in the area ratio of a loop with a given length and apex area cause a general rise in electron density and a fall in the temperature gradient, leading to large increases in the differential emission factor at high temperatures. The differential function obtained is significantly different from that predicted by analytical models; however, analytical predictions for the temperature-electron density relations are comparable to numerical results. It is also concluded that even a symmetrical loop may have a maximum temperature away from the apex.},

  abstract = {We systematically investigate the effects of geometrical assumptions in one-dimensional (1D) models of coronal loops. Many investigations of coronal loops have been based on restrictive assumptions, including symmetry in the loop shape and heating profile, and a uniform cross-sectional area. Starting with a solution for a symmetric uniform-area loop with uniform heating, we gradually relax these restrictive assumptions to consider the effects of nonuniform area, nonuniform heating, a nonsymmetric loop shape, and nonsymmetric heating, to show that the character of the solutions can change in important ways. We find that loops with nonuniform cross-sectional area are more likely to experience thermal nonequilibrium, and that they produce significantly enhanced coronal emission, compared with their uniform-area counterparts. We identify a process of incomplete condensation in loops experiencing thermal nonequilibrium during which the coronal parts of loops never fully cool to chromospheric temperatures. These solutions are characterized by persistent siphon flows. Their properties agree with observations (Lionello et al.) and may not suffer from the drawbacks that led Klimchuk et al. to conclude that thermal nonequilibrium is not consistent with observations. We show that our 1D results are qualitatively similar to those seen in a three-dimensional model of an active region. Our results suggest that thermal nonequilibrium may play an important role in the behavior of coronal loops, and that its dismissal by Klimchuk et al., whose model suffered from some of the restrictive assumptions we described, may have been premature.},

  abstract = {The onset of the acceleration of ions during magnetic reconnection is explored via particle-in-cell simulations in the limit of a strong ambient guide field that self-consistently and simultaneously follow the motions of protons and $\alpha$ particles. Heating parallel to the local magnetic field during reconnection with a guide field is strongly reduced compared with the reconnection of anti-parallel magnetic fields. The dominant heating of thermal ions during guide field reconnection results from pickup behavior of ions during their entry into reconnection exhausts and dominantly produces heating perpendicular rather than parallel to the local magnetic field. Pickup behavior requires that the ion transit time across the exhaust boundary (with a transverse scale of the order of the ion sound Larmor radius) be short compared with the ion cyclotron period. This translates into a threshold in the strength of reconnecting magnetic field that favors the heating of ions with high mass-to-charge. A simulation with a broad initial current layer produces a reconnecting system in which the amplitude of the reconnecting magnetic field just upstream of the dissipation region increases with time as reconnection proceeds. The sharp onset of perpendicular heating when the pickup threshold is crossed is documented. A comparison of the time variation of the parallel and perpendicular ion heating with that predicted based on the strength of the reconnecting field establishes the scaling of ion heating with ambient parameters both below and above the pickup threshold. The relevance to observations of ion heating in the solar corona is discussed.},

Solutions to the equation may be used to compute the time dependence of the average coronal temperature and emission measure for an assumed temporal variation of the flare heating rate. The results computed from the model agree reasonably well with recent published numerical simulations and may be obtained with far less computational effort.

Spectrometer (EIS) observations of strong iron spectral lines have shown
sharply peaked distributions around 3 MK. EIS observations of lines
emitted by a range of elements have allowed good estimates of abundances
relative to iron. However, X-ray observations are required to measure
the plasma emission above 3 MK and the abundances of oxygen and neon. We
revisit, using up-to-date atomic data, older X-ray observations obtained
by a sounding rocket and by the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM) Flat Crystal
Spectrometer (FCS). We find that the Fe/O and Fe/Ne ratios are normally
increased by a factor of 3.2, compared to the photospheric values.
Similar results are obtained from FCS observations of six quiescent
active region cores. The FCS observations also indicate that the
emission measure above 3 MK has a very steep negative slope, with very
little plasma observed at 5 MK or above.

systematic shift of the absolute values, the EIS (EM(T)) being smaller

causes of this discrepancy, and we discuss the influence of the
assumptions for the plasma element abundances. Specifically, we find
that the disagreement between the results from the two instruments is
significantly mitigated by assuming chemical composition closer to the
solar photospheric composition rather than the often adopted "coronal"
composition. We find that the data do not provide conclusive evidence on
the high temperature (log T(K) $>$\textasciitilde{} 6.5) tail of the plasma temperature

We couple the time-dependent ion balance equations to the hydrodynamic equations in order to treat the energy loss through radiation in a self-consistent way by allowing for the emission from a potentially nonequilibrium ion population.

We present results for the response to the changing conditions in the loop of the population of C VII ions and find significant deviations from equilibrium in the coronal and footpoint regions of the loop. The former is due to the tenuous nature of the coronal plasma causing recombinations to be rare and the latter is due to the strong downflows that develop as the loop cools, which carry persistent C VII ions into the lower regions of the loop. We also present a comparison between total plasma emissivity curves calculated during this simulation and an almost identical simulation that assumed an equilibrium ion population for the calculation of the radiation term. As a result of the
nonequilibrium ion populations we find significant differences between the emissivity curves of each simulation and the loop cooling times.

We suggest that a consideration of nonequilibrium ionisation and radiation might help to (a) explain the thermal broadening observed in some emission lines during explosive events, and (b) reconcile
differences between theory and observations relating to the longevity of some loops observed in the TRACE filters.},

  abstract = {Aims:The interpretation of astrophysical spectra depends directly on a knowledge of the ionization state of the emitting plasma. This is determined, in part, from collisional ionization rate coefficients. The most recent assessments of these were performed by Arnaud \&
Rothenflug (1985, A\&AS, 60, 425) and Arnaud \& Raymond (1992,
ApJ, 398, 394). Since their work, new laboratory measurements of ionization cross sections have become available as well as the Flexible Atomic Code (FAC) which enables theoretical calculations of these rates. Our goal is to provide a complete set of ionization rate coefficients for the elements hydrogen through zinc. Methods: A scaling law, which assists the analysis of ionization cross sections and rate coefficients, has been developed following the approach of Burgess \& Tully (1992, A\&A, 254, 436). Essentially all available measured
cross sections along each isoelectronic sequence have been examined and compared to cross sections calculated with the Flexible Atomic Code (FAC) and with other calculations. Two approaches has been taken to provide a complete set of ionization cross sections. In the first, fits to scaled measured ionization cross sections, particularly for neutral and singly ionized species, are performed. In the second, fits to scaled calculated direct ionization and excitation-autoionization cross sections are performed to provide the remainder of the set. The fits to the cross sections are then integrated over a Maxwellian velocity distribution to derive ionization rate coefficients. Results: A complete set of ground level ionization cross sections and rate
coefficients has been developed through the combination of these two approaches. A tabulation of parameter fits to ground level ionization rate coefficients for all atoms and ions of the elements of H through Zn is provided.

general dynamical dissipation in the magnetic fields that produce the
active corona of the Sun. The footpoints of the field are continually
manipulated by the subphotospheric convection, so that the lines of
force are continually wrapped and rotated about each other. The
dynamical dissipation of the wrapping and rotation transfers the work
done on the footpoints directly into heat in the corona, at a rate
estimated to be of the order of 107 ergs cm-2
s-1. The effect appears to be the principal source of heat to
the visible corona.

This general picture implies that all magnetic fields extending outward
from convecting astronomical bodies produce intense heating of the
tenuous outer atmospheres of those bodies, in general agreement with the
observed fact of the universal activity of stars and galaxies.},

the physical mechanism(s) of the heating. The differential emission

distinction, through the amplitude of the DEM slope coolward of the
coronal peak. It is therefore crucial to understand the uncertainties
associated with these measurements. Using proper estimations of the
uncertainties involved in the problem of DEM inversion, we derive
confidence levels on the observed DEM slope. Results show that the
uncertainty in the slope reconstruction strongly depends on the number
of lines constraining the slope. Typical uncertainty is estimated to be
about $\pm$1.0 in the more favorable cases.},

solar active region using instruments on Hinode and the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO). These multi-instrument observations allow us to
determine the distribution of plasma temperatures and follow the
evolution of emission at different temperatures. We find that at the
apex of the high-temperature loops the emission measure distribution is
strongly peaked near 4 MK and falls off sharply at both higher and lower
temperatures. Perhaps most significantly, the emission measure at 0.5 MK
is reduced by more than two orders of magnitude from the peak at 4 MK.
We also find that the temporal evolution in broadband soft X-ray images
is relatively constant over about 6 hr of observing. Observations in the
cooler SDO/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) bandpasses generally do
not show cooling loops in the core of the active region, consistent with
the steady emission observed at high temperatures. These observations
suggest that the high-temperature loops observed in the core of an
active region are close to equilibrium. We find that it is possible to
reproduce the relative intensities of high-temperature emission lines
with a simple, high-frequency heating scenario where heating events
occur on timescales much less than a characteristic cooling time. In
contrast, low-frequency heating scenarios, which are commonly invoked to
describe nanoflare models of coronal heating, do not reproduce the

low-temperature emission that is approximately an order of magnitude too

of such hot plasma is currently debated. The SphinX instrument on-board
the CORONAS-PHOTON mission is sensitive to X-ray emission of energies
well above 1 keV and provides the opportunity to detect the hot plasma
component. Methods: We analysed the X-ray spectra of the solar
corona collected by the SphinX spectrometer in May 2009 (when two active
regions were present). We modelled the spectrum extracted from the whole
Sun over a time window of 17 days in the 1.34-7 keV energy band by
adopting the latest release of the APED database. Results: The
SphinX broadband spectrum cannot be modelled by a single isothermal
component of optically thin plasma and two components are necessary. In
particular, the high statistical significance of the count rates and the
accurate calibration of the spectrometer allowed us to detect a very hot
component at \textasciitilde{}7 million K with an emission measure of \textasciitilde{}2.7 \texttimes{}
1044 cm-3. The X-ray emission from the hot plasma
dominates the solar X-ray spectrum above 4 keV. We checked that this hot
component is invariably present in both the high and low emission
regimes, i.e. even excluding resolvable microflares. We also present and
discuss the possibility of a non-thermal origin (which would be
compatible with a weak contribution from thick-target bremsstrahlung)
for this hard emission component. Conclusions: Our results
support the nanoflare scenario and might confirm that a minor flaring
activity is ever-present in the quiescent corona, as also inferred for
the coronae of other stars.},

reconnection of the field takes place. It is shown here that the invariance is also a sufficient condition for the existence of a fluid pressure distribution producing static equilibrium. Even in the simplest cases, however, the requirements on the fluid pressure are extreme and, a priori, are unlikely. It is concluded that almost all twisted flux tubes packed together produce dynamical nonequilibrium and dissipation of their twisting. This is the basic effect underlying the long-standing conjecture that the shuffling of the footpoints of the bipolar magnetic fields in the sun is responsible for heating the active corona.
Attention is then given to the consequences of this general dynamical dissipation in the magnetic fields that produce the active corona of the sun. The footpoints of the field are continually manipulated by the subphotospheric convection in such a way that the lines of force are continually wrapped and rotated about one another.},

The AIA consists of four telescopes that employ normal-incidence, multilayer-coated optics to provide narrow-band imaging of seven extreme ultraviolet (EUV) band passes centered on specific lines: Fe xviii (94 \AA{}), Fe viii, xxi (131 \AA{}), Fe ix (171 \AA{}), Fe xii, xxiv (193 \AA{}), Fe xiv (211 \AA{}), He ii (304 \AA{}), and Fe xvi (335 \AA{}). One telescope observes C iv (near 1600 \AA{}) and the nearby continuum (1700 \AA{}) and has a filter that observes in the visible to enable coalignment with images from other telescopes. The temperature diagnostics of the EUV emissions cover the range from 6\texttimes{}104 K to 2\texttimes{}107 K. The AIA was launched as a part of NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) mission on 11 February 2010. AIA will advance our understanding of the mechanisms of solar variability and of how the Sun's energy is stored and released into the heliosphere and geospace.},

plasma observed in the solar corona are based on short bursts of energy.
The intensities and velocities measured in the cores of quiescent active

heating scenario that has been proposed to reconcile such observations
with impulsive heating models is the "long nanoflare storm," where
short-duration heating events occur infrequently on many sub-resolution
strands; the emission of the strands is then averaged together to
explain the observed steady structures. In this Letter, we examine the
emission measure distribution predicted for such a long nanoflare storm
by modeling an arcade of strands in an active region core. Comparisons
of the computed emission measure distributions with recent observations
indicate that the long nanoflare storm scenario implies greater than
five times more 1 MK emission than is actually observed for all
plausible combinations of loop lengths, heating rates, and abundances.
We conjecture that if the plasma had "super coronal" abundances, the
model may be able to match the observations at low temperatures.},

With cooled detectors, high sensitivity, and high spectral resolution, EUNIS-13 resolves the lines of Fe XIX at 592.2 \AA{} (formed at temperature T 8.9 MK) and Fe XII at 592.6 \AA{} (T 1.6 MK). The Fe XIX line emission, observed over an area in excess of 4920 arcsec2 (2.58 \texttimes{} 109 km2, more than 60\% of the active region), provides strong evidence for the nanoflare heating model of the solar corona. No GOES events occurred in the region less than 2 hr before the rocket flight, but a microflare was observed north and east of the region with RHESSI and EUNIS during the flight. The absence of significant upward velocities anywhere in the region, particularly the microflare, indicates that the pervasive Fe XIX emission is not propelled outward from the microflare site, but is most likely attributed to localized heating (not necessarily due to reconnection) consistent with the nanoflare heating model of the solar corona. Assuming ionization equilibrium we estimate Fe XIX/Fe XII emission measure ratios of \textasciitilde{}0.076 just outside the AR core and \textasciitilde{}0.59 in the core.},

full-sphere magnetic field maps for 2000 December 1 and 8, when the Sun was moderately active, we populate nearly 50,000 coronal field lines with quasi-static loop atmospheres. These atmospheres are based on heating flux densities FH that depend in different ways on the loop half-length L, the field strength B at the chromospheric base, the loop expansion with height, and the heating scale height. The best match to X-ray and EUV observations of the corona over active regions and their environs is found for
FH\textasciitilde{}4\texttimes{}1014B1.0+/-0.3/L1.0+/-0.5 (in ergs cm-2 s-1 for B in Mx cm-2 and L in cm), while allowing for substantial loop expansion with increasing height, and for a heating scale height that is at least a sizeable fraction of the loop length. This scaling for coronal heating points to DC reconnection at tangential discontinuities as the most likely coronal heating mechanism, provided that the reconnection progresses
proportional to the Alfv\'en velocity. The best-fit coronal filling factor equals unity, suggesting that most of the corona is heated most of the time. We find evidence that loops with half-lengths exceeding \textasciitilde{}100,000 km are heated significantly more than suggested by the above scaling, possibly commensurate with the power deposited in the open field of coronal holes.},

The extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emissions are then computed and compared with observations. The heating mechanism is inspired by a theory on Alfv\'en wave turbulence dissipation. The magnetic structure is built from a Solar and Heliospheric Observatory ( SOHO )/MDI magnetogram and an estimated torsion parameter deduced from observations. We found that the solution to the equations in some locations is in a thermal nonequilibrium state. The time variation of the density and temperature profiles leads to time dependent emissions, which appear as thin, loop-like structures with uniform cross-section. Their timescale is consistent with the lifetime of observed coronal loops. The dynamic nature of the solution also leads to plasma flows that resemble observed coronal rain. The computed EUV emissions from the coronal part of the fan loops and the high loops compare favorably with SOHO /EIT observations in a quantitative comparison. However, the computed emission from the lower atmosphere is excessive compared to observations, a symptom common to many models. Some factors for this discrepancy are suggested, including the use of coronal abundances to compute the emissions and the neglect of atmospheric opacity effects.},

Unfortunately, the temperature of the upper atmosphere cannot be observed directly, but must be inferred from spectrally resolved observations of individual emission lines that span a wide range of temperatures. Such observations are ``inverted'' to determine the distribution of plasma temperatures along the line of sight. This inversion is ill posed and, in the absence of regularization, tends to produce wildly oscillatory solutions. We introduce the application of sparse Bayesian inference to the problem of inferring the temperature structure of the solar corona. Within a Bayesian framework a preference for solutions that utilize a minimum number of basis functions can be encoded into the prior and many ad hoc assumptions can be avoided. We demonstrate the efficacy of the Bayesian approach by considering a test library of 40 assumed temperature distributions.},

We show that while some sets of light curves exhibit clear evidence of
cooling after nanoflare storms, other cases are less straightforward to

  abstract = {The light curves of solar coronal loops often peak first in channels associated with higher temperatures and then in those associated with lower temperatures. The delay times between the different narrowband EUV channels have been measured for many individual loops and recently for every pixel of an active region observation. The time delays between channels for an active region exhibit a wide range of values. The maximum time delay in each channel pair can be quite large, i.e., $>$5000 s. These large time delays make-up 3\%\textendash{}26\% (depending on the channel pair) of the pixels where a trustworthy, positive time delay is measured. It has been suggested that these time delays can be explained by simple impulsive heating, i.e., a short burst of energy that heats the plasma to a high temperature, after which the plasma is allowed to cool through radiation and conduction back to its original state. In this paper, we investigate whether the largest observed time delays can be explained by this hypothesis by simulating a series of coronal loops with different heating rates, loop lengths, abundances, and geometries to determine the range of expected time delays between a set of four EUV channels. We find that impulsive heating cannot address the largest time delays observed in two of the channel pairs and that the majority of the large time delays can only be explained by long, expanding loops with photospheric abundances. Additional observations may rule out these simulations as an explanation for the long time delays. We suggest that either the time delays found in this manner may not be representative of real loop evolution, or that the impulsive heating and cooling scenario may be too simple to explain the observations, and other potential heating scenarios must be explored.},

The active corona needs additional heating to reach 2,000,000-4,000,000\,K; this heat has been theoretically proposed to come from the reconnection and unravelling of magnetic /`braids/'. Evidence favouring that process has been inferred, but has not been generally accepted because observations are sparse and, in general, the braided magnetic strands that are thought to have an angular width of about 0.2\,arc seconds have not been resolved. Fine-scale braiding has been seen in the chromosphere but not, until now, in the corona. Here we report observations, at a resolution of 0.2\,arc seconds, of magnetic braids in a coronal active region that are reconnecting, relaxing and dissipating sufficient energy to heat the structures to about 4,000,000\,K. Although our 5-minute observations cannot unambiguously identify the field reconnection and subsequent relaxation as the dominant heating mechanism throughout active regions, the energy available from the observed field relaxation in our example is ample for the observed heating.},

  abstract = {Various mechanisms have been proposed to heat the solar corona, but none have been completely successful in accounting for its observed
characteristics. Recently a further candidate has been advanced; namely, stochastic heating via a large number of tiny impulsive energy-release events, the so-called nanoflares. In this paper we develop a simple semianalytical model to describe the temporal evolution of the nanoflare plasma and to determine the response of magnetic flux tubes of different sizes to typical nanoflare energy releases. This allows us to show how the repeated occurrence of low-energy events in an originally cool loop may eventually build up a high-temperature plasma a nanoflare-heated corona. We also calculate the average nanoflare rate of occurrence, as a function of loop size, required to keep the plasma at coronal
temperatures. The collective effect of this minievent population is shown to account for the observed coronal temperature and global emission measure. The present estimates may be used as guidelines for defining the requisites of future experiments aimed at observationally testing the nanoflare heating hypothesis.},

By assuming that quiescent loop structures observed in X-rays are in hydrostatic equilibrium, it is demonstrated that such loops must have their temperature maximum located near their apex and that substantial nonradiative energy deposition must occur along most of their length. The calculations yield a unique relation among loop temperature, pressure, and size, which fits the X-ray observations of quiescent structures well and is consistent with the initial assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. The results suggest that the coronal loops visible in X-rays represent a relatively
steady-state equilibrium of the confined plasmas and that fluctuations in such quantities as the local heating rate can lead to dynamically unstable states in which the loop plasma does not attain a temperature sufficient for X-ray emission. A parameterization of various proposed coronal heating theories is also developed within the context of the analytical model.},

technique to 10 active regions observed with the Mees Solar Observatory
Imaging Vector Magnetograph and the Yohkoh Soft X-ray Telescope. We
produce synthetic images of each region using four parameterized heating
relationships depending on magnetic field strength and geometry. We find
a volumetric coronal heating rate (dEH/dV, not to be confused
with dEH/dA quoted by some authors) proportional to magnetic
field and inversely proportional to field-line loop length
(BL-1) best matches observed coronal emission
morphologies. This parameterization is most similar to the steady-state
scaling of two proposed heating mechanisms: van Ballegooijen's "current
layers" theory, taken in the AC limit, and Parker's "critical angle"
mechanism, in the case where the angle of misalignment is a twist angle.
Although this parameterization best matches the observations, it does
not match well enough to make a definitive statement as to the nature of
coronal heating. Instead, we conclude that (1) the technique requires
better magnetic field measurement and extrapolation techniques than
currently available, and (2) forward-modeling methods that incorporate
properties of transiently heated loops are necessary to make a more
conclusive statement about coronal heating mechanisms.},

redshifts, which correspond to bulk downflows. For an impulsively heated

predictions of any proposed theory of heating. However, the nature of
the bulk downflows raises the possibility that enthalpy may play a key
role in the energy balance of the loops and in particular that it powers
the transition region radiation. In this Letter, we use one-dimensional
hydrodynamic simulations of loop cooling to show that enthalpy losses
from the corona are easily sufficient to power the transition region
radiation. This contrasts with the long-held view that downward thermal
conduction powers the transition region. The traditional distinction
between the transition region and the corona in terms of temperature
alone is then a grossly unphysical simplification, and a proper
definition of the interface between these atmospheric layers requires a
detailed knowledge of their energy balance. To this end, we propose a
robust new definition of the transition region.},

We model the evolution of a bundle of strands heated by a storm of nanoflares by means of a hydrodynamic 0D loop model (EBTEL). The light curves obtained from a random combination of those of single strands are compared to the observed light curves either in a single pixel or in a row of pixels, simultaneously in the two channels, and using two independent methods: an artificial intelligent system (Probabilistic Neural Network) and a simple cross-correlation technique. We explore the space of the parameters to constrain the distribution of the heat pulses, their duration, their spatial size, and, as a feedback on the data, their signatures on the light curves. From both methods the best agreement is obtained for a relatively large population of events (1000) with a short duration (less than 1 minute) and a relatively shallow distribution (power law with index 1.5) in a limited energy range (1.5 decades). The feedback on the data indicates that bumps in the light curves, especially in the 94 \AA{} channel, are signatures of a heating excess that occurred a few minutes before.},

  doi = {10.1088/0067-0049/194/2/26},
  abstract = {The "smoking gun" of small-scale, impulsive events heating the solar 
corona is expected to be the presence of hot ($>$5 MK) plasma. Evidence
for this has been scarce, but has gradually begun to accumulate due to
recent studies designed to constrain the high-temperature part of the
emission measure distribution. However, the detected hot component is
often weaker than models predict and this is due in part to the common
modeling assumption that the ionization balance remains in equilibrium.
The launch of the latest generation of space-based observing
instrumentation on board Hinode and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
has brought the matter of the ionization state of the plasma firmly to
the forefront. It is timely to consider exactly what emission current
instruments would detect when observing a corona heated impulsively on
small scales by nanoflares. Only after we understand the full effects of
nonequilibrium ionization can we draw meaningful conclusions about the
plasma that is (or is not) present. We have therefore performed a series
of hydrodynamic simulations for a variety of different nanoflare
properties and initial conditions. Our study has led to several key
conclusions. (1) Deviations from equilibrium are greatest for
short-duration nanoflares at low initial coronal densities. (2) Hot
emission lines are the most affected and are suppressed sometimes to the
point of being invisible. (3) For the many scenarios we have considered,
the emission detected in several of the SDO-AIA channels (131, 193, and
211 \AA{}) would be dominated by warm, overdense, cooling plasma. (4)
It is difficult not to create coronal loops that emit strongly at 1.5 MK
and in the range 2-6 MK, which are the most commonly observed kind, for
a broad range of nanoflare scenarios. (5) The Fe XV (284.16 \AA{})
emission in most of our models is about 10 times brighter than the Ca
XVII (192.82 \AA{}) emission, consistent with observations. Our
overarching conclusion is that small-scale, impulsive heating inducing a
nonequilibrium ionization state leads to predictions for observable
quantities that are entirely consistent with what is actually observed.},

If an observed coronal loop is assumed to consist of many small strands that cannot be distinguished spatially by EUV or X-ray observations, we are able to calculate differential emission-measure profiles and filling factors for a range of heating models. In this picture the strands undergo continual heating and cooling, leading to a corona comprising strands with a broad range of temperatures and densities. Thus, observations over a range of temperatures will show a multithermal coronal structure. The cyclical heating-cooling leads inevitably to loops that are underdense and overdense at high and low temperatures, respectively, compared to what would be expected from static equilibrium models, and in addition, we show that differential emission-measure profiles with shallow slopes can be obtained, as reported in recent observations. The differences between filling factors that can be seen by broadband and narrowband instruments are explored. Loops with broadband filling factors near unity can still have small narrowband factors, and the narrowband factor is shown to be a strong function of the local temperature. Nanoflare energy distributions that are constant, flat, or power laws are considered. Power laws lead to wide distributions of temperatures and densities in the corona, and steep power laws lead to larger filling factors.},

  abstract = {We present a new computational approach that addresses the difficulty of 
obtaining the correct interaction between the solar corona and the
transition region, in response to rapid heating events. In the coupled
corona, transition region, and chromosphere system, an enhanced downward
conductive flux results in an upflow (chromospheric evaporation).
However, obtaining the correct upflow generally requires high spatial
resolution in order to resolve the transition region. With an unresolved
transition region, artificially low coronal densities are obtained
because the downward heat flux "jumps" across the unresolved region to
the chromosphere, underestimating the upflows. Here, we treat the lower
transition region as a discontinuity that responds to changing coronal
conditions through the imposition of a jump condition that is derived
from an integrated form of energy conservation. To illustrate and
benchmark this approach against a fully resolved one-dimensional model,
we present field-aligned simulations of coronal loops in response to a
range of impulsive (spatially uniform) heating events. We show that our
approach leads to a significant improvement in the coronal density
evolution than just when using coarse spatial resolutions insufficient
to resolve the lower transition region. Our approach compensates for the
jumping of the heat flux by imposing a velocity correction that ensures
that the energy from the heat flux goes into driving the transition
region dynamics, rather than being lost through radiation. Hence, it is
possible to obtain improved coronal densities. The advantages of using
this approach in both one-dimensional hydrodynamic and three-dimensional
magnetohydrodynamic simulations are discussed.},

  abstract = {The location and frequency of coronal energy release provide a significant constraint on the coronal heating mechanism. The evolution of the intensity observed in coronal structures found from time lag analysis of Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) data has been used to argue that heating must occur sporadically. Recently, we have demonstrated that quasi-steady, highly stratified (footpoint) heating can produce results qualitatively consistent with the evolution of observed coronal structures. The goals of this paper are to demonstrate that time lag analysis of 3D simulations of footpoint heating are qualitatively consistent with time lag analysis of observations and to use the 3D simulations to further understand whether time lag analysis is a useful tool in defining the evolution of coronal structures. We find the time lag maps generated from simulated data are consistent with the observed time lag maps. We next investigate several example points. In some cases, the calculated time lag reflects the evolution of a unique loop along the line of sight, though there may be additional evolving structures along the line of sight. We confirm that using the multi-peak AIA channels can produce time lags that are difficult to interpret. We suggest using a different high temperature channel, such as an X-ray channel. Finally, we find that multiple evolving structures along the line of sight can produce time lags that do not represent the physical properties of any structure along the line of sight, although the cross-correlation coefficient of the lightcurves is high. Considering the projected geometry of the loops may reduce some of the line-of-sight confusion.},

  abstract = {The bulk of solar coronal radiative loss consists of soft X-ray emission 
from quasi-static loops at the cores of active regions. In order to
develop diagnostics for determining the heating mechanism of these loops
from observations by coronal imaging instruments, I have developed
analytical solutions for the temperature structure and scaling laws of
loop strands for a set of temperature- and pressure-dependent heating
functions that encompass heating concentrated at the footpoints, uniform
heating, and heating concentrated at the loop apex. Key results are that
the temperature profile depends only weakly on the heating
distribution\textemdash{}not sufficiently to be of significant diagnostic
value\textemdash{}and that the scaling laws survive for this wide range of
heating distributions, but with the constant of proportionality in the
Rosner-Tucker-Vaiana scaling law (P 0 L \textasciitilde{} T 3
max) depending on the specific heating function. Furthermore,
quasi-static solutions do not exist for an excessive concentration of
heating near the loop footpoints, a result in agreement with recent
numerical simulations. It is demonstrated that a generalization of the
results to a set of solutions for strands with a functionally prescribed
variable diameter leads to only relatively small correction factors in
the scaling laws and temperature profiles for constant diameter loop
strands. A quintet of leading theoretical coronal heating mechanisms is
shown to be captured by the formalism of this paper, and the differences
in thermal structure between them may be verified through observations.
Preliminary results from full numerical simulations demonstrate that,
despite the simplifying assumptions, the analytical solutions from this
paper are accurate and stable.},

ratios that are insensitive to density and temperature are used to check
both the quality of the atomic data and the calibration of the

to density to estimate the electron density from different ions. In
general we find excellent agreement between theory and observation,
providing confidence in both the atomic data in the CHIANTI database and
the quality of the SERTS-89 spectrum. Where inconsistencies between
theory and observation exist we try to explain them in terms of either
inaccuracies in the atomic data or blending of the lines. One consistent
discrepancy was that all observed lines that we analysed in the
lambr\{430\}\{450\} region were uniformly a factor of 1.5--2.0 weaker than
predicted, suggesting that the SERTS-89 calibration may need adjustment
in this spectral interval. Serious problems were also found in some of

  abstract = {Recently, we suggested that the source of ion heating in solar coronal holes is small-scale reconnection events (microflares) at the coronal base. The microflares launch intermittent heat flux up into the corona exciting ion cyclotron waves through a plasma microinstability. The ions are heated by these waves during the microflare bursts and then evolve with no energy input between the bursts. In this paper, we show that the structure of the proton distribution in the relatively long time periods between the microflares is determined by collisions at small heliocentric distances. At greater distances, the collisional processes can be replaced by similar processes due to secondary instabilities. These are excited by the distortion of the distribution under the action of the mirror force. At the same time, the heating during the microflare bursts is not affected by either the collisions or the secondary instabilities because of the short duration of the bursts. We demonstrate that in each intermittent heating event the protons diffuse approximately along one-dimensional curves in the phase space and can develop a quasi-plateau. The corresponding temperature increase can then be calculated without solving the diffusion equations. The overall coronal heating by this mechanism is a summed effect of all microflare bursts during the expansion time of the solar wind and adiabatic cooling between the microflares. The calculations for the collision-dominated region suggest that the overall heating is efficient enough to account for the acceleration of the fast solar wind in this region.},

relatively large amount of warm plasma, suggesting that the hot active

consideration of uncertainties yields a range in which as many as 77\% of
observed active regions are consistent with low-frequency nanoflare

explain observed slopes greater than 3; (4) the upper limit to the

that can occur when the heating is both highly stratified and
quasi-constant. Unambiguous observational identification of TNE would
thus permit us to strongly constrain heating scenarios. While TNE is
currently the standard interpretation of coronal rain, the long-term
periodic evolution predicted by simulations has never been observed.
However, the detection of long-period intensity pulsations (periods of
several hours) has been recently reported with the Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory/EIT, and this phenomenon appears to be very
common in loops. Moreover, the three intensity-pulsation events that we
recently studied with the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly (AIA) show strong evidence for TNE in warm loops. In this
paper, a realistic loop geometry from linear force-free field (LFFF)
extrapolations is used as input to 1D hydrodynamic simulations. Our
simulations show that, for the present loop geometry, the heating has to
be asymmetrical to produce TNE. We analyze in detail one particular
simulation that reproduces the average thermal behavior of one of the
pulsating loop bundle observed with AIA. We compare the properties of
this simulation with those deduced from the observations. The magnetic
topology of the LFFF extrapolations points to the presence of sites of
preferred reconnection at one footpoint, supporting the presence of
asymmetric heating. In addition, we can reproduce the temporal
large-scale intensity properties of the pulsating loops. This simulation
further strengthens the interpretation of the observed pulsations as
signatures of TNE. This consequently provides important information on
the heating localization and timescale for these loops.},

turn our attention to heating by a finite succession of impulsive events
for which the timescale between events on a single magnetic strand is
shorter than the cooling timescale. We refer to this scenario as a

nanoflare trains are consistent with 86\% to 100\% of observed active

the time interval between successive events ($\tau$ C ); (3)

  abstract = {The structure and dynamics of the solar corona is dominated by the magnetic field. In most areas in the corona magnetic forces are so dominant that all non-magnetic forces like plasma pressure gradient and gravity can be neglected in the lowest order. This model assumption is called the force-free field assumption, as the Lorentz force vanishes. This can be obtained by either vanishing electric currents (leading to potential fields) or the currents are co-aligned with the magnetic field lines. First we discuss a mathematically simpler approach that the magnetic field and currents are proportional with one global constant, the so-called linear force-free field approximation. In the generic case, however, the relation between magnetic fields and electric currents is nonlinear and analytic solutions have been only found for special cases, like 1D or 2D configurations. For constructing realistic nonlinear force-free coronal magnetic field models in 3D, sophisticated numerical computations are required and boundary conditions must be obtained from measurements of the magnetic field vector in the solar photosphere. This approach is currently of large interests, as accurate measurements of the photospheric field become available from
ground-based (for example SOLIS) and space-born (for example Hinode and SDO) instruments. If we can obtain accurate force-free coronal magnetic field models we can calculate the free magnetic energy in the corona, a quantity which is important for the prediction of flares and coronal mass ejections. Knowledge of the 3D structure of magnetic field lines also help us to interpret other coronal observations, e.g., EUV images of the radiating coronal plasma.},

  abstract = {Nanoflares, short and intense heat pulses within spatially unresolved 
magnetic strands, are now considered a leading candidate to solve the
coronal heating problem. However, the frequent occurrence of nanoflares
requires that flare-hot plasma be present in the corona at all times.
Its detection has proved elusive until now, in part because the
intensities are predicted to be very faint. Here, we report on the
analysis of an active region observed with five filters by Hinode/X-Ray
Telescope (XRT) in 2006 November. We have used the filter ratio method
to derive maps of temperature and emission measure (EM) both in soft and
hard ratios. These maps are approximate in that the plasma is assumed to
be isothermal along each line of sight. Nonetheless, the hardest
available ratio reveals the clear presence of plasma around 10 MK. To
obtain more detailed information about the plasma properties, we have
performed Monte Carlo simulations assuming a variety of nonisothermal EM
distributions along the lines of sight. We find that the observed filter
ratios imply bi-modal distributions consisting of a strong cool (log T \textasciitilde{}
6.3 - 6.5) component and a weaker (few percent) and hotter (6.6 $<$ log
T $<$ 7.2) component. The data are consistent with bi-modal
distributions along all lines of sight, i.e., throughout the active
region. We also find that the isothermal temperature inferred from a
filter ratio depends sensitively on the precise temperature of the cool
component. A slight shift of this component can cause the hot component
to be obscured in a hard ratio measurement. Consequently, temperature
maps made in hard and soft ratios tend to be anti-correlated. We
conclude that this observation supports the presence of widespread
nanoflaring activity in the active region.},

physical properties of longitudinal oscillations in large coronal loops.
The 38 examples of propagating disturbances were obtained from the
analysis of high cadence, 171 \AA{} TRACE data (JOP 83 and JOP 144).
The majority of these outward propagating oscillations are found in the
footpoints of large diffuse coronal loop structures, close to active
regions. The disturbances travel outward with a propagation speed of the
order of v$\approx$122$\pm$43 km s-1. The variations in
intensity are estimated to be roughly 4.1$\pm$1.5\% of the background
loop brightness. The propagating disturbances are found to be damped
very quickly and are typically only detected in the first 8.9$\pm$4.4
Mm along the loop. Using a wavelet analysis, periods of the order of
282$\pm$93 s are found and the energy flux was estimated as
342$\pm$126 erg cm-2 s-1. We found highly
filamentary behavior in the lower part of the coronal loops and showed
that the intensity oscillations can be present for several consecutive
hours, with a more or less constant period. It is evident that the
longitudinal oscillations are a widespread, regularly occurring coronal
phenomena. A companion paper is devoted to the interpretation and

The moss is believed to be due to million-degree emission from the transition regions at the footpoints of coronal loops whose maximum temperatures are several million degrees. The two key results from the TRACE observations discussed in this paper are that in the moss regions one generally sees only moss, not
million-degree loops, and that the moss emission exhibits only weak intensity variations, \textasciitilde{}10\% over periods of hours. TRACE movies showing these results are presented. We demonstrate, using both analytic and numerical calculations, that the lack of observable million-degree loops in the moss regions places severe constraints on the possible time variability of coronal heating in the loops overlying the moss. In particular, the heating in the hot moss loops cannot be truly flarelike with a sharp cutoff, but instead must be quasi-steady to an excellent approximation. Furthermore, the lack of significant variations in the moss intensity implies that the heating magnitude is only weakly varying. The implications of these conclusions for coronal heating models will be discussed.},

In this Letter, we demonstrate that a "blind spot" exists in temperature-emission measure space for combined Hinode EIS and XRT observations. For a typical active region core with significant emission at 3-4 MK, Hinode EIS and XRT are insensitive to plasma with temperatures greater than \textasciitilde{}6 MK and emission measures less than
\textasciitilde{}1027 cm-5. We then demonstrate that the
temperature and emission measure limits of this blind spot depend upon the temperature distribution of the plasma along the line of sight by considering a hypothetical emission measure distribution sharply peaked at 1 MK. For this emission measure distribution, we find that EIS and XRT are insensitive to plasma with emission measures less than

  abstract = {The question of what heats the solar corona remains one of the most important problems in astrophysics. Finding a definitive solution involves a number of challenging steps, beginning with an identification of the energy source and ending with a prediction of observable quantities that can be compared directly with actual observations. Critical intermediate steps include realistic modeling of both the energy release process (the conversion of magnetic stress energy or wave energy into heat) and the response of the plasma to the heating. A variety of difficult issues must be addressed: highly disparate spatial scales, physical connections between the corona and lower atmosphere, complex microphysics, and variability and dynamics. Nearly all of the coronal heating mechanisms that have been proposed produce heating that is impulsive from the perspective of elemental magnetic flux strands. It is this perspective that must be adopted to understand how the plasma responds and radiates. In our opinion, the most promising explanation offered so far is Parker's idea of nanoflares occurring in magnetic fields that become tangled by turbulent convection. Exciting new developments include the identification of the ``secondary instability'' as the likely mechanism of energy release and the demonstration that impulsive heating in sub-resolution strands can explain certain observed properties of coronal loops that are otherwise very difficult to understand. Whatever the detailed mechanism of energy release, it is clear that some form of magnetic reconnection must be occurring at significant altitudes in the corona (above the magnetic carpet), so that the tangling does not increase indefinitely. This article outlines the key elements of a comprehensive strategy for solving the coronal heating problem and warns of obstacles that must be overcome along the way.},

  abstract = {The solar corona is orders of magnitude hotter than the underlying photosphere, but how the corona attains such high temperatures is still not understood. Soft X-ray (SXR) emission provides important diagnostics for thermal processes in the high-temperature corona, and is also an important driver of ionospheric dynamics at Earth. There is a crucial observational gap between \texttildelow{}0.2 and \texttildelow{}4 keV, outside the ranges of existing spectrometers. We present observations from a new SXR
spectrometer, the Amptek X123-SDD, which measured the spatially
integrated solar spectral irradiance from \texttildelow{}0.5 to \texttildelow{}5 keV, with
\texttildelow{}0.15 keV FWHM resolution, during sounding rocket flights on 2012 June 23 and 2013 October 21. These measurements show that the highly variable SXR emission is orders of magnitude greater than that during the deep minimum of 2009, even with only weak activity. The observed spectra show significant high-temperature (5-10 MK) emission and are well fit by simple power-law temperature distributions with indices of \texttildelow{}6, close to the predictions of nanoflare models of coronal
heating. Observations during the more active 2013 flight indicate an enrichment of low first-ionization potential elements of only \texttildelow{}1.6, below the usually observed value of \texttildelow{}4, suggesting that abundance variations may be related to coronal heating processes. The XUV
Photometer System Level 4 data product, a spectral irradiance model derived from integrated broadband measurements, significantly
overestimates the spectra from both flights, suggesting a need for revision of its non-flare reference spectra, with important implications for studies of Earth ionospheric dynamics driven by solar SXRs.},

  abstract = {Aims: To demonstrate the capabilities of regularized inversion to 
recover differential emission measures (DEMs) from multi-wavelength
observations provided by telescopes such as Hinode and SDO. 
Methods: We develop and apply an enhanced regularization algorithm, used
in RHESSI X-ray spectral analysis, to constrain the ill-posed inverse
problem that is determining the DEM from solar observations. We
demonstrate this computationally fast technique applied to a range of
DEM models simulating broadband imaging data from SDO/AIA and high
resolution line spectra from Hinode/EIS, as well as actual active region
observations with Hinode/EIS and XRT. As this regularization method
naturally provides both vertical and horizontal (temperature resolution)
error bars we are able to test the role of uncertainties in the data and
response functions. Results: The regularization method is able to
successfully recover the DEM from simulated data of a variety of model
DEMs (single Gaussian, multiple Gaussians and CHIANTI DEM models). It is
able to do this, at best, to over four orders of magnitude in DEM space
but typically over two orders of magnitude from peak emission. The
combination of horizontal and vertical error bars and the regularized
solution matrix allows us to easily determine the accuracy and
robustness of the regularized DEM. We find that the typical range for
the horizontal errors is $\Delta$log T $\approx$ 0.1-0.5 and this is dependent
on the observed signal to noise, uncertainty in the response functions
as well as the source model and temperature. With Hinode/EIS an
uncertainty of 20\% greatly broadens the regularized DEMs for both
Gaussian and CHIANTI models although information about the underlying
DEMs is still recoverable. When applied to real active region
observations with Hinode/EIS and XRT the regularization method is able
to recover a DEM similar to that found via a MCMC method but in
considerably less computational time. Conclusions: Regularized
inversion quickly determines the DEM from solar observations and
provides reliable error estimates (both horizontal and vertical) which
allows the temperature spread of coronal plasma to be robustly
quantified.},

  abstract = {The concept that the corona is heated by small flares (named 'nanoflares' by Parker) is examined. A model in which the closed, active region corona is comprised of many hundred of small elemental flux loops randomly heated by nanoflares is presentd. The cooling of these flux loops is examined using analytic techniques. It is assumed that the heated loops cool initially by conduction and at later times by
radiation. Radiative cooling with and without downward mass flows are discussed, the experimental signature of such a coronal model are predicted. The distribution of temperatures in these loops peaks at around 2 x 106 K, while the distribution of densities peaks above 1010/cu cm. For 2 x 105 K less than T less than 106 K, radiative cooling with mass flows gives an emission measure that scales as T1.5, in agreement with existing observations. For T greater than 106 K, the emission measure increases more steeply, scaling as T4.5. These scalings are entirely due to the temperature dependence of the radiative loss function. It is shown that such a loop model has filling factors (defined as the ratio of the volume of hot plasma to the total volume) of order unity for subarcsecond energy release scales. A brief survey of the dependence of the results on the parameters of the system is presented. The temperature distribution function and emission measure are relatively insensitive to the loop length, coronal energy loss, number of elemental loops, and nanoflare energy, but the filling factor is dependent on these quantities. A simple scaling for this dependence is presented.},

  abstract = {The minimum-energy configuration for the magnetic field above the solar photosphere is curl-free (hence, by Amp\`ere's law, also
current-free), so can be represented as the gradient of a scalar potential. Since magnetic fields are divergence free, this scalar potential obeys Laplace's equation, given an appropriate boundary condition (BC). With measurements of the full magnetic vector at the photosphere, it is possible to employ either Neumann or Dirichlet BCs there. Historically, the Neumann BC was used with available
line-of-sight magnetic field measurements, which approximate the radial field needed for the Neumann BC. Since each BC fully determines the 3D vector magnetic field, either choice will, in general, be inconsistent with some aspect of the observed field on the boundary, due to the presence of both currents and noise in the observed field. We present a method to combine solutions from both Dirichlet and Neumann BCs to determine a hybrid, "least-squares" potential field, which minimizes the integrated square of the residual between the potential and actual fields. We also explore weighting the residuals in the fit by spatially uniform measurement uncertainties. This has advantages both in not overfitting the radial field used for the Neumann BC, and in maximizing consistency with the observations. We demonstrate our methods with SDO/HMI vector magnetic field observations of active region 11158, and find that residual discrepancies between the observed and potential fields are significant, and they are consistent with nonzero horizontal photospheric currents. We also analyze potential fields for two other active regions observed with two different vector magnetographs, and find that hybrid-potential fields have significantly less energy than the Neumann fields in every case - by more than 10\^\{32\} erg in some cases. This has major implications for estimates of free magnetic energy in coronal field models, e.g., non-linear force-free field
extrapolations.},

  abstract = {Observational and theoretical evidence suggests that coronal heating is impulsive and occurs on very small cross-field spatial scales. A single coronal loop could contain a hundred or more individual strands that are heated quasi-independently by nanoflares. It is therefore an enormous undertaking to model an entire active region or the global corona. Three-dimensional MHD codes have inadequate spatial resolution, and one-dimensional (1D) hydrodynamic codes are too slow to simulate the many thousands of elemental strands that must be treated in a reasonable representation. Fortunately, thermal conduction and flows tend to smooth out plasma gradients along the magnetic field, so zero-dimensional (0D) models are an acceptable alternative. We have developed a highly efficient model called ``enthalpy-based thermal evolution of loops'' (EBTEL), which accurately describes the evolution of the average temperature, pressure, and density along a coronal strand. It improves significantly on earlier models of this type-in accuracy, flexibility, and capability. It treats both slowly varying and highly impulsive coronal heating; it provides the time-dependent differential emission measure distribution, DEM(T), at the transition region footpoints; and there are options for heat flux saturation and nonthermal electron beam heating. EBTEL gives excellent agreement with far more sophisticated 1D hydrodynamic simulations despite using 4 orders of magnitude less computing time. It promises to be a powerful new tool for solar and stellar studies.},

collisionally dominated, high temperature, optically thin sources. Methods: A complete set of ground level ionization and recombination
rate coefficients has been assembled for all atoms and ions of the
elements of H through Zn and inserted into the latest version of the
CHIANTI database, CHIANTI 6. Ionization rate coefficients are taken from
the recent work of Dere (2007, A\&A, 466, 771) and recombination
rates from a variety of sources in the literature. These new rate
coefficients have allowed the calculation of a new set of ionization
equilibria and radiative loss rate coefficients. For some ions, such as
Fe VIII and Fe IX, there are significant differences from previous
calculations. In addition, existing atomic parameters have been revised
and new atomic parameters inserted into the database. Results:
For each ion in the CHIANTI database, elemental abundances, ionization
potentials, atomic energy levels, radiative rates, electron and proton
collisional rate coefficients, ionization and recombination rate
coefficients, and collisional ionization equilibrium populations are
provided. In addition, parameters for the calculation of the continuum

Aims: .We study the physics associated with nanoflare heating in this scenario and aim to determine whether there exist any observable signatures. Methods: .We derive an analytical model in order to gain some simple physical insights into the system and use a one dimensional hydrodynamic model that treats the electrons and ions as a coupled fluid to simulate nanoflare heating with time-scales of 30 s. Our analytical model also provide a means of verifying our numerical results. Results: .We find that diffuse loops containing plasma at T$>$ 20 MK can be rapidly created and subsequently filled by the violent evaporation of chromospheric plasma driven by near-saturated thermal conduction. Most importantly, we find order-of-magnitude departures from equilibrium of the ionisation balance for iron and use this result to identify a potential signature of this heating
mechanism. Conclusions: .We conclude that nanoflare heating can account for the presence of extremely high temperature plasma in a corona with low filling factor. We find that near-saturated thermal conduction may play a key role at the onset of chromospheric evaporation and a non-equilibrium ionisation balance is absolutely inevitable. The high temperatures could never be directly measured in the corona due to the small emission measure and the most promising signature of such heating is blue-shifted plasma from the loop footpoints. We find reason for cautious optimism that this signature can be detected by future space-based spectroscopic instrumentation (e.g. SolarB-EIS).},

  abstract = {A well-known behavior of EUV light curves of discrete coronal loops is 
that the peak intensities of cooler channels or spectral lines are
reached at progressively later times than hotter channels. This time lag
is understood to be the result of hot coronal loop plasma cooling
through these lower respective temperatures. However, loops typically
comprise only a minority of the total emission in active regions (ARs).
Is this cooling pattern a common property of AR coronal plasma, or does
it only occur in unique circumstances, locations, and times? The new
Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA) data
provide a wonderful opportunity to answer this question systematically
for an entire AR. We measure the time lag between pairs of SDO/AIA EUV
channels using 24 hr of images of AR 11082 observed on 2010 June 19. We
find that there is a time-lag signal consistent with cooling plasma,
just as is usually found for loops, throughout the AR including the
diffuse emission between loops for the entire 24 hr duration. The
pattern persists consistently for all channel pairs and choice of window
length within the 24 hr time period, giving us confidence that the
plasma is cooling from temperatures of greater than 3 MK, and sometimes
exceeding 7 MK, down to temperatures lower than \textasciitilde{}0.8 MK. This suggests
that the bulk of the emitting coronal plasma in this AR is not steady;
rather, it is dynamic and constantly evolving. These measurements
provide crucial constraints on any model which seeks to describe coronal
heating.},

resolved maps of the EM slope in the 1-3 MK range within the core of the

differential emission measure (DEM). A significant variation of the
slope is found at different spatial locations within the active region.
We selected two regions that were not greatly affected by lower
temperature emission along the line of sight. We found that the EM had a
power law of the form EM $\propto$ Tb, with b = 4.4 $\pm$
0.4, and 4.6 $\pm$ 0.4, during the first and second appearance of the
active region, respectively. During the second rotation, line-of-sight
effects become more important, although difficult to estimate. We found
that the use of the ground calibration for Hinode/EIS and the
approximate method to derive the EM, used in previous publications,
produce an underestimation of the slopes. The EM distribution in active
region cores is generally found to be consistent with high frequency
heating, and does not change much during the evolution of the active
region.},

simulations of nanoflare trains are used to demonstrate the dependence

delay between consecutive nanoflares proportional to the energy of the
second nanoflare do lead to the observed range of a. However,
TN must then be of the order of hundreds to no more than a
few thousand seconds. If a nanoflare leads to the relaxation of a
stressed coronal field to a near-potential state, the time taken to
build up the required magnetic energy is thus too long to account for
the EM measurements. Instead, it is suggested that a nanoflare involves
the relaxation from one stressed coronal state to another, dissipating
only a small fraction of the available magnetic energy. A consequence is
that nanoflare energies may be smaller than previously envisioned.},

heating over a range of magnitudes using one-dimensional hydrodynamic

resolution is on the coronal density. An underresolved loop typically
has a peak density of at least a factor of two lower than a resolved
loop subject to the same heating, with larger discrepancies in the decay
phase. The temperature for underresolved loops is also lower indicating
that lack of resolution does not "bottle up" the heat flux in the
corona. Energy is conserved in the models to under 1\% in all cases,
indicating that this is not responsible for the low density. Instead, we
argue that in underresolved loops the heat flux "jumps across" the
transition region to the dense chromosphere from which it is radiated
rather than heating and ablating transition region plasma. This
emphasizes the point that the interaction between corona and
chromosphere occurs only through the medium of the transition region.

this paper, we couple observations of active region (AR) 10955 made with
the X-Ray Telescope and the EUV Imaging Spectrometer on board Hinode to
test a simple steady heating model. First we calculate the differential
emission measure (DEM) of the apex region of the loops in the active
region core. We find the DEM to be broad and peaked around 3 MK. We then
determine the densities in the corresponding footpoint regions. Using
potential field extrapolations to approximate the loop lengths and the
density-sensitive line ratios to infer the magnitude of the heating, we
build a steady heating model for the active region core and find that we
can match the general properties of the observed DEM for the temperature
range of 6.3 $<$ log T $<$ 6.7. This model, for the first time,
accounts for the base pressure, loop length, and distribution of apex
temperatures of the core loops. We find that the density-sensitive
spectral line intensities and the bulk of the hot emission in the active
region core are consistent with steady heating. We also find, however,
that the steady heating model cannot address the emission observed at
lower temperatures. This emission may be due to foreground or background
structures, or may indicate that the heating in the core is more
complicated. Different heating scenarios must be tested to determine if
they have the same level of agreement.},

  abstract = {In Bradshaw \& Mason ($\backslash$cite\{Bradshaw2003\}) we carried out a hydrodynamic simulation of a cooling solar loop and investigated the nonequilibrium response of the population of C VII ions to the changing conditions in the plasma. We also compared equilibrium and
nonequilibrium calculations of the total plasma emissivity. In this paper we present two simulations of a solar loop subject to a transient heating process delivering energy on the nanoflare scale at its apex. One simulation treats the ion populations and the energy radiated from the loop plasma entirely as though the system were in equilibrium and the other simulation performs a full nonequilibrium treatment by coupling the time-dependent ion populations to the hydrodynamic
equations through the radiative energy loss. Our radiative model accounts for the 15 most abundant elements of the solar atmosphere including C, O, Ne, Mg, Si and Fe.

We find some pronounced differences between the populations of certain transition region ions and the corresponding plasma emissivity curves in the equilibrium and nonequilibrium simulations. Though the apex heating event is relatively weak in comparison to energy released on the microflare and flare scales, nonetheless a significant amount of energy reaches the loop footpoint region to heat the plasma there and we find a nonequilibrium spike in emissivity. However, more surprisingly we find considerable differences between some of the coronal ions in the equilibrium and nonequilibrium simulations, with important consequences for the plasma emissivity curves. In particular, we find that the total plasma emissivity calculated assuming equilibrium conditions is up to a factor of 5 lower than the nonequilibrium emissivity and this is due almost entirely to the response of the coronal Fe ions.

Finally, we suggest possible observational signatures of nonequilibrium ionisation and ways in which one might identify it. This is important because an invalid assumption of equilibrium ion populations may well lead one to incorrect conclusions about the properties of the plasma in both a broad-band and narrow-band/emission line based analysis.

at some or, in the case of the Enthalpy-based Thermal Evolution of Loops

  abstract = {Recent observations of coronal loops in EUV wavelengths with the 
Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) and the
Extreme-Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) on the Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) demonstrated three new results that
cannot be explained by most of the existing loop models: (1) EUV loops
are near-isothermal along their coronal segments, (2) they show an
overpressure or overdensity compared with the requirements of steady
state loops with uniform heating, and (3) the brightest EUV loops
exhibit extended scale heights up to 4 times the hydrostatic scale
height. These observations cannot be reconciled with the classical RTV
(Rosner, Tucker, \& Vaiana) model, they do not support models with
uniform heating, and they even partially violate the requirements of
hydrostatic equilibrium. In this study we are fitting for the first time
steady state solutions of the hydrodynamic equations to observed
intensity profiles, permitting a detailed consistency test of the
observed temperature T(s) and density profiles ne(s) with
steady state models, which was not possible in previous studies based on
scaling laws. We calculate some 500 hydrostatic solutions, which cover a
large parameter space of loop lengths (L\textasciitilde{}4-300 Mm), of nonuniform
heating functions (with heating scale heights in the range of
$\lambda$H\textasciitilde{}1-300 Mm), approaching also the limit of uniform
heating ($\lambda$H$>>$L). The parameter space can be
subdivided into three regimes, which contain (1) solutions of stably
stratified loops, (2) solutions of unstably stratified loops (in the
case of short heating scale heights,
$\lambda$H,Mm\textasciitilde{}LMm), and (3) a regime in which we
find no numerical solutions (when
$\lambda$H,Mm$<$\textasciitilde{}LMm). Fitting the hydrostatic
solutions to 41 EUV loops observed with TRACE (selected by the criterion
of detectability over their entire length), we find that only 30\% of the
loops are consistent with hydrostatic steady state solutions. None of
the observed EUV loops is consistent with a uniform heating function
while in quasi-steady state. Those loops compatible with a steady state
are found to be heated near the footpoints, with a heating scale height
of $\lambda$H=12+/-5 Mm, covering a fraction
$\lambda$H/L=0.2+/-0.1 of the loop length. These results
support coronal heating mechanisms operating in or near the chromosphere

observations. Our aim is not to reproduce a particular set of
observations in detail, but to recover some typical properties and patterns observed in active regions. Our key findings are the following. (1) Cooling dominates the time lag signature and the time lags between the channel pairs are generally consistent with observed values. (2) Shorter coronal loops in the core cool more quickly than longer loops at the periphery. (3) All channel pairs show zero time lag when the line of sight passes through coronal loop footpoints. (4) There is strong evidence that plasma must be re-energized on a timescale comparable to the cooling timescale to reproduce the observed coronal activity, but it is likely that a relatively broad spectrum of heating frequencies are operating across active regions. (5) Due to their highly dynamic nature, we find nanoflare trains produce zero time lags along entire flux tubes in our model active region that are seen between the same channel pairs in observed active regions.},

  abstract = {This paper presents SunPy (version 0.5), a community-developed Python package for solar physics. Python, a free, cross-platform,
general-purpose, high-level programming language, has seen widespread adoption among the scientific community, resulting in the availability of a large number of software packages, from numerical computation (NumPy, SciPy) and machine learning (scikit-learn) to visualization and plotting (matplotlib). SunPy is a data-analysis environment specializing in providing the software necessary to analyse solar and heliospheric data in Python. SunPy is open-source software (BSD licence) and has an open and transparent development workflow that anyone can contribute to. SunPy provides access to solar data through integration with the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO), the Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase (HEK), and the HELiophysics Integrated Observatory (HELIO) webservices. It
currently supports image data from major solar missions (e.g., SDO, SOHO, STEREO, and IRIS), time-series data from missions such as GOES, SDO/EVE, and PROBA2/LYRA, and radio spectra from e-Callisto and
STEREO/SWAVES. We describe SunPy's functionality, provide examples of solar data analysis in SunPy, and show how Python-based solar data-analysis can leverage the many existing tools already available in Python. We discuss the future goals of the project and encourage interested users to become involved in the planning and development of SunPy.},

out of the 38 cases presented in Paper I did we find a significant
perturbation in the 195 \AA{} TRACE data. The loops supporting the
propagating disturbances were typically stable, quiescent loops and the
total luminosity of the analyzed structures generally varied by no more
than 10\%. The observed density oscillations are unlikely to be
flare-driven and are probably caused by an underlying driver exciting
the loop footpoints. It was demonstrated that the rapid damping of the
perturbations could not simply be explained as a consequence of the
decreasing intensity along the loops. However, we found that (slightly
enhanced) thermal conduction alone could account for the observed
damping lengths and wavelengths, and, additionally, explain the
correlation between propagation period and damping length.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we examine 15 different active regions (ARs) observed with the Solar Dynamics Observatory and analyze their nanoflare properties. We have recently developed a technique that systematically identifies and measures plasma temperature dynamics by computing time lags between light curves. The time lag method tests whether the plasma is maintained at a steady temperature, or if it is dynamic, undergoing heating and cooling cycles. An important aspect of our technique is that it analyzes both observationally distinct coronal loops as well as the much more prevalent diffuse emission between them. We find that the widespread cooling reported previously for NOAA AR 11082 is a generic property of all ARs. The results are consistent with impulsive nanoflare heating followed by slower cooling. Only occasionally, however, is there full cooling from above 7 MK to well below 1 MK. More often, the plasma cools to approximately 1\textendash{}2 MK before being reheated by another nanoflare. These same 15 ARs were first studied by Warren et al. We find that the degree of cooling is not well correlated with the reported slopes of the emission measure distribution. We also conclude that the Fe xviii emitting plasma that they measured is mostly in a state of cooling. These results support the idea that nanoflares have a distribution of energies and frequencies, with the average delay between successive events on an individual flux tube being comparable to the plasma cooling timescale.},

  abstract = {Recent measurements have shown that the quiet unstructured solar corona observed at the solar limb is close to isothermal, at a temperature that does not appear to change over wide areas or with time. Some individual active region loop structures have also been found to be nearly
isothermal both along their axis and across their cross section. Even a complex active region observed at the solar limb has been found to be composed of three distinct isothermal plasmas. If confirmed, these results would pose formidable challenges to the current theoretical understanding of the thermal structure and heating of the solar corona. For example, no current theoretical model can explain the excess densities and lifetimes of many observed loops if the loops are in fact isothermal. All of these measurements are based on the so-called emission measure (EM) diagnostic technique that is applied to a set of optically thin lines under the assumption of isothermal plasma. It provides simultaneous measurement of both the temperature and EM. In this work, we develop a new method to quantify the uncertainties in the technique and to rigorously assess its ability to discriminate between isothermal and multithermal plasmas. We define a formal measure of the uncertainty in the EM diagnostic technique that can easily be applied to real data. We here apply it to synthetic data based on a variety of assumed plasma thermal distributions and develop a method to
quantitatively assess the degree of multithermality of a plasma.},

efficient two-fluid hydrodynamic model, this paper investigates the
properties of the emission expected from repeating nanoflares (a
nanoflare train) of varying frequency as well as the separate heating of
electrons and ions. If the emission measure distribution (EM(T)) peaks
at T = T m , we find that EM(T m ) is
independent of details of the nanoflare train, and EM(T) above and below
T m reflects different aspects of the heating. Below T
 m , the main influence is the relationship of the waiting
time between successive nanoflares to the nanoflare energy. Above T
 m , power-law nanoflare distributions lead to an extensive
plasma population not present in a mono-energetic train. Furthermore, in
some cases, characteristic features are present in EM(T). Such details
may be detectable given adequate spectral resolution and a good
knowledge of the relevant atomic physics. In the absence of such
resolution we propose some metrics that can be used to infer the
presence of ``hot'' plasma.},

  abstract = {The corona and transition region (TR) are fundamentally coupled through 
the processes of thermal conduction and mass exchange. It is not
possible to understand one without the other. Yet the
temperature-dependent emissions from the two locations behave quite
differently in the aftermath of an impulsive heating event such as a
coronal nanoflare. Whereas the corona cools sequentially, emitting first
at higher temperatures and then at lower temperatures, the TR is
multithermal and the emission at all temperatures responds in unison. We
have previously applied the automated time lag technique of Viall \&
Klimchuk to disk observations of an active region (AR) made by the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory.
Lines of sight passing through coronal plasma show clear evidence for
post-nanoflare cooling, while lines of sight intersecting the TR
footpoints of coronal strands show zero time lag. In this paper, we use
the EBTEL hydrodynamics code to demonstrate that this is precisely the
expected behavior when the corona is heated by nanoflares. We also apply
the time lag technique for the first time to off-limb observations of an
AR. Since TR emission is not present above the limb, the occurrence of
zero time lags is greatly diminished, supporting the conclusion that
zero time lags measured on the disk are due to TR plasma. Lastly, we
show that the ''coronal'' channels in AIA can be dominated by bright TR
emission. When defined in a physically meaningful way, the TR reaches a
temperature of roughly 60\% the peak temperature in a flux tube. The TR
resulting from impulsive heating can extend to 3 MK and higher, well
within the range of the ''coronal'' AIA channels.},

  abstract = {Aims: In previous studies, a very hot plasma component has been diagnosed in solar active regions through the images in three different narrow-band channels of Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). This diagnostic from extreme
ultraviolet (EUV) imaging data has also been supported by the matching morphology of emission in the hot Ca XVII line, as observed with Extreme-Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on board Hinode. This evidence is debated because of the unknown distribution of the emission measure along the line of sight. Here we investigate in detail the thermal distribution of one such region using EUV spectroscopic data. Methods: In an active region observed with SDO/AIA, Hinode/EIS, and X-ray telescope (XRT), we select a sub-region with a very hot plasma component and another cooler sub-region for comparison. The average spectrum is extracted for both, and 14 intense lines are selected for analysis that probe the 5.5 $<$ log T $<$ 7 temperature range
uniformly. From these lines, the emission measure distributions are reconstructed with the Markov-chain Monte Carlo method. Results are cross-checked in comparison with the two sub-regions, with a different inversion method, with the morphology of the images, and with the addition of fluxes measured with narrow, and broadband imagers. Results: We find that, whereas the cool region has a flat and
featureless distribution that drops at temperature log T $\geq$ 6.3, the distribution of the hot region shows a well-defined peak at log T = 6.6 and gradually decreasing trends on both sides, thus supporting the very hot nature of the hot component diagnosed with imagers. The other cross-checks are consistent with this result. Conclusions: This study provides a completion of the analysis of active region components, and the resulting scenario supports the presence of a minor very hot plasma component in the core, with temperatures log T $>$ 6.6.},

disturbing event, although this determination becomes uncertain as the elements in the plasma return to ionization equilibrium. A general solution for the equilibrium timescale for each element arises from the elegant eigenvector method of solution to the problem of a
non-equilibrium plasma described by Masai and Hughes \& Helfand. In general, the ionization evolution of an element Z in a constant electron temperature plasma is given by a coupled set of Z + 1 first-order differential equations. However, they can be recast as Z uncoupled first-order differential equations using an eigenvector basis for the system. The solution is then Z separate exponential functions, with the time constants given by the eigenvalues of the rate matrix. The smallest of these eigenvalues gives the scale of the slowest return to
equilibrium independent of the initial conditions, while conversely the largest eigenvalue is the scale of the fastest change in the ion population. These results hold for an ionizing plasma, a recombining plasma, or even a plasma with random initial conditions, and will allow users of these diagnostics to determine directly if their best-fit result significantly limits the timescale since a disturbance or is so close to equilibrium as to include an arbitrarily long time.},

              . Each event would heat and cool quickly, and the average effect would be a broad range of temperatures including a small amount of extremely hot plasma. However, detecting these faint, hot traces in the presence of brighter, cooler emission is observationally challenging. Here we present hard X-ray data from the second flight of the Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager (FOXSI-2), which detected emission above 7\,keV from an active region of the Sun with no obvious individual X-ray flare emission. Through differential emission measure computations, we ascribe this emission to plasma heated above 10\,MK, providing evidence for the existence of solar nanoflares. The quantitative evaluation of the hot plasma strongly constrains the coronal heating models. The authors detect hard X-ray emission produced by plasma heated at $\geq$10 million kelvin from a quiescent active region of the Sun, providing clear observational evidence of plasma heating by nanoflares, and hinting at their important role in coronal heating.},

region (AR) in various non-flaring areas, as it provides key information
on the way these structures are heated. In particular, we concentrate on
the very hot component ($>$ 3 \{MK\}) as it is a crucial element to
distinguish between different heating mechanisms. We present an analysis
using Fe and Ca emission lines from both the Solar Ultraviolet
Measurement of Emitted Radiation (SUMER) on board the Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS)
on board Hinode. A data set covering all ionization stages from Fe x to
Fe xix has been used for the thermal analysis (both differential
emission measure and emission measure, EM). Ca xiv is used for the
SUMER-EIS radiometric cross calibration. We show that the very hot
plasma is present and persistent almost everywhere in the core of the
limb AR. The off-limb AR is clearly structured in Fe xviii. Almost
everywhere, the EM analysis reveals plasma at 10 MK (visible in Fe xix
emission), which is down to 0.1\% of EM of the main 3 \{MK\} plasma. We
estimate the power-law index of the hot tail of the EM to be between
-8.5 and -4.4. However, the question about the possible
existence of a small minor peak at around 10 \{MK\} remains open. The
absence in some part of the AR of the Fe xix and Fe xxiii lines (which
fall into our spectral range) enables us to determine an upper limit on
the EM at these temperatures. Our results include a new Ca xiv 943.59

These new observations make possible a unified description of both phenomena. Coronal rain and periodic intensity pulsations of loops are two manifestations of the same physical process: evaporation/condensation cycles resulting from a state of thermal nonequilibrium. The fluctuations around coronal temperatures produce the intensity pulsations of loops, and rain falls along their legs if thermal runaway cools the periodic condensations down and below transition-region temperatures. This scenario is in line with the predictions of numerical models of quasi-steadily and footpoint heated loops. The presence of coronal rain\textemdash{}albeit non-periodic\textemdash{}in several other structures within the studied field of view implies that this type of heating is at play on a large scale.},

An automated processing pipeline keeps pace with observations to produce observable quantities, including the photospheric vector magnetic field, from sequences of filtergrams. The basic vector-field frame list cadence is 135 seconds, but to reduce noise the filtergrams are combined to derive data products every 720 seconds. The primary 720 s observables were released in mid-2010, including Stokes polarization parameters measured at six wavelengths, as well as intensity, Doppler velocity, and the line-of-sight magnetic field. More advanced products, including the full vector magnetic field, are now available. Automatically identified HMI Active Region Patches (HARPs) track the location and shape of magnetic regions throughout their lifetime.The vector field is computed using the Very Fast Inversion of the Stokes Vector (VFISV) code optimized for the HMI pipeline; the remaining 180$\circ$ azimuth ambiguity is resolved with the Minimum Energy (ME0) code. The Milne\textendash{}Eddington inversion is performed on all full-disk HMI observations. The disambiguation, until recently run only on HARP regions, is now implemented for the full disk. Vector and scalar quantities in the patches are used to derive active region indices potentially useful for forecasting; the data maps and indices are collected in the SHARP data series, hmi.sharp\_720s. Definitive SHARP processing is completed only after the region rotates off the visible disk; quick-look products are produced in near real time. Patches are provided in both CCD and heliographic coordinates.HMI provides continuous coverage of the vector field, but has modest spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution. Coupled with limitations of the analysis and interpretation techniques, effects of the orbital velocity, and instrument performance, the resulting measurements have a certain dynamic range and sensitivity and are subject to systematic errors and uncertainties that are characterized in this report.},

FOXSI has performed the first focused hard X-ray (HXR) observation of the Sun in its first successful flight on 2012 November\,2. Focusing optics, combined with small strip detectors, enable high-sensitivity observations with respect to previous indirect imagers. This capability, along with the sensitivity of the HXR regime to high-temperature emission, offers the potential to better characterize high-temperature plasma in the corona as predicted by nanoflare heating models. We present a joint analysis of the differential emission measure (DEM) of active region 11602 using coordinated observations by FOXSI, Hinode/XRT, and Hinode/EIS. The Hinode-derived DEM predicts significant emission measure between 1\,MK and 3\,MK, with a peak in the DEM predicted at 2.0\textendash{}2.5\,MK. The combined XRT and EIS DEM also shows emission from a smaller population of plasma above 8\,MK. This is contradicted by FOXSI observations that significantly constrain emission above 8\,MK. This suggests that the Hinode DEM analysis has larger uncertainties at higher temperatures and that \&gt;\,8\,MK plasma above an emission measure of 3 \texttimes{} 1044\,cm-3 is excluded in this active region.},

  abstract = {Solar flares accelerate particles up to high energies (MeV and GeV scales for electrons and ions, respectively) through efficient acceleration processes that are not currently understood. Hard X-rays (HXRs) are the most direct diagnostic of flare-accelerated electrons. However, past and current solar HXR observers lack the necessary sensitivity and imaging dynamic range to make detailed studies of faint HXR sources in the solar corona (where particle acceleration is thought to occur); these limitations are mainly due to the indirect Fourier imaging techniques used by these observers. With greater sensitivity and dynamic range, electron acceleration sites could be systematically studied in detail. Both these capabilities can be advanced by the use of direct focusing optics. The recently own Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager (FOXSI) sounding rocket payload demonstrates the unique diagnostic power of focusing optics for observations of solar HXRs. FOXSI features grazing-incidence replicated nickel optics with \textasciitilde{}5 arcsecond resolution and fine-pitch silicon strip detectors with a \textasciitilde{}7.7 arcsecond strip pitch. FOXSI flew successfully on 2012 November 2, producing images and spectra of a microflare and performing a search for non-thermal emission (4\{15 keV) from nanoflares occurring outside active regions in the quiet Sun. A future spacecraft version of FOXSI, featuring similar optics and detectors, could make detailed observations of HXRs from flare-accelerated electrons, identifying and characterizing particle acceleration sites and mapping out paths of energetic electrons as they leave these sites and propagate throughout the solar corona. This paper will describe the FOXSI instrument and present images from the first flight.\vphantom\}},

We construct a 3D model of the magnetic field in this active region by extrapolating the surface magnetic field into the corona and using SDO/AIA images of coronal loops to ensure that extrapolated magnetic field lines co-align with observed coronal loops. We trace 2848 magnetic field lines within the volume of this active region and model how they fill with hot plasma in response to nanoflare heating. We perform a parameter study to determine how the frequency and energy released in nanoflares scale with magnetic field strength and loop length. From our 3D model, we construct synthetic images of the lines observed by EUNIS and EIS and constrain the parameter study by minimizing the difference between the synthetic and observed images.},

  abstract = {Long-period EUV pulsations, recently discovered to be common in active regions, are understood to be the coronal manifestation of thermal nonequilibrium (TNE). The active regions previously studied with EIT/Solar and Heliospheric Observatory and AIA/SDO indicated that long-period intensity pulsations are localized in only one or two loop bundles. The basic idea of this study is to understand why. For this purpose, we tested the response of different loop systems, using different magnetic configurations, to different stratifications and strengths of the heating. We present an extensive parameter-space study using 1D hydrodynamic simulations (1020 in total) and conclude that the occurrence of TNE requires specific combinations of parameters. Our study shows that the TNE cycles are confined to specific ranges in parameter space. This naturally explains why only some loops undergo constant periodic pulsations over several days: since the loop geometry and the heating properties generally vary from one loop to another in an active region, only the ones in which these parameters are compatible exhibit TNE cycles. Furthermore, these parameters (heating and geometry) are likely to vary significantly over the duration of a cycle, which potentially limits the possibilities of periodic behavior. This study also confirms that long-period intensity pulsations and coronal rain are two aspects of the same phenomenon: both phenomena can occur for similar heating conditions and can appear simultaneously in the simulations.},

This review focuses on the optically thin emission from the solar atmosphere, mostly found at UV and X-ray (XUV) wavelengths, and discusses some of the diagnostic methods that have been used to measure electron densities, electron temperatures, differential emission measure (DEM), and relative chemical abundances. We mainly focus on methods and results obtained from high-resolution spectroscopy, rather than broad-band imaging.

We also mainly focus the review on measurements of electron densities and temperatures obtained from single ion diagnostics, to avoid issues related to the ionisation state of the plasma. We start the review with a short historical introduction on the main XUV high-resolution spectrometers, then review the basics of optically thin emission and the main processes that affect the formation of a spectral line. We mainly discuss plasma in equilibrium, but briefly mention non-equilibrium ionisation and non-thermal electron distributions. We also summarise the status of atomic data, which are an essential part of the diagnostic process. We then review the methods used to measure electron densities, electron temperatures, the DEM, and relative chemical abundances, and the results obtained for the lower solar atmosphere (within a fraction of the solar radii), for coronal holes, the quiet Sun, active regions and flares.},

@misc{waskom_seaborn_2018,
  title = {Seaborn: V0.9.0},
  shorttitle = {Mwaskom/{{Seaborn}}},
  abstract = {v0.9.0 (July 2018)
Note: a version of these release notes with working links appears in the online documentation.
This is a major release with several substantial and long-desired new features. There are also updates/modifications to the themes and color palettes that give better consistency with matplotlib 2.0 and some notable API changes.
New relational plots
Three completely new plotting functions have been added: catplot, scatterplot, and lineplot. The first is a figure-level interface to the latter two that combines them with a FacetGrid. The functions bring the high-level, dataset-oriented API of the seaborn categorical plotting functions to more general plots (scatter plots and line plots).
These functions can visualize a relationship between two numeric variables while mapping up to three additional variables by modifying $<$code$>$hue$<$/code$>$, $<$code$>$size$<$/code$>$, and/or $<$code$>$style$<$/code$>$ semantics. The common high-level API is implemented differently in the two functions. For example, the size semantic in scatterplot scales the area of scatter plot points, but in lineplot it scales width of the line plot lines. The API is dataset-oriented, meaning that in both cases you pass the variable in your dataset rather than directly specifying the matplotlib parameters to use for point area or line width.
Another way the relational functions differ from existing seaborn functionality is that they have better support for using numeric variables for $<$code$>$hue$<$/code$>$ and $<$code$>$size$<$/code$>$ semantics. This functionality may be propagated to other functions that can add a $<$code$>$hue$<$/code$>$ semantic in future versions; it has not been in this release.
The lineplot function also has support for statistical estimation and is replacing the older $<$code$>$tsplot$<$/code$>$ function, which still exists but is marked for removal in a future release. lineplot is better aligned with the API of the rest of the library and more flexible in showing relationships across additional variables by modifying the size and style semantics independently. It also has substantially improved support for date and time data, a major pain factor in $<$code$>$tsplot$<$/code$>$. The cost is that some of the more esoteric options in $<$code$>$tsplot$<$/code$>$ for representing uncertainty (e.g. a colormapped KDE of the bootstrap distribution) have not been implemented in the new function.
There is quite a bit of new documentation that explains these new functions in more detail, including detailed examples of the various options in the API reference and a more verbose tutorial.
These functions should be considered in a "stable beta" state. They have been thoroughly tested, but some unknown corner cases may remain to be found. The main features are in place, but not all planned functionality has been implemented. There are planned improvements to some elements, particularly the default legend, that are a little rough around the edges in this release. Finally, some of the default behavior (e.g. the default range of point/line sizes) may change somewhat in future releases.
Updates to themes and palettes
Several changes have been made to the seaborn style themes, context scaling, and color palettes. In general the aim of these changes was to make the seaborn styles more consistent with the style updates in matplotlib 2.0 and to leverage some of the new style parameters for better implementation of some aspects of the seaborn styles. Here is a list of the changes:

Reorganized and updated some axes\_style/plotting\_context parameters to take advantage of improvements in the matplotlib 2.0 update. The biggest change involves using several new parameterss in the "style" spec while moving parameters that used to implement the corresponding aesthetics to the "context" spec. For example, axes spines and ticks are now off instead of having their width/length zeroed out for the darkgrid style. That means the width/length of these elements can now be scaled in different contexts. The effect is a more cohesive appearance of the plots, especially in larger contexts. These changes include only minimal support for the 1.x matplotlib series. Users who are stuck on matplotlib 1.5 but wish to use seaborn styling may want to use the seaborn parameters that can be accessed through the matplotlib stylesheet interface.
Updated the seaborn palettes ("deep", "muted", "colorblind", etc.) to correspond with the new 10-color matplotlib default. The legacy palettes are now available at "deep6", "muted6", "colorblind6", etc. Additionally, a few individual colors were tweaked for better consistency, aesthetics, and accessibility.
Calling color\_palette (or set\_palette) with a named qualitative palettes (i.e. one of the seaborn palettes, the colorbrewer qualitative palettes, or the matplotlib matplotlib tableau-derived palettes) and no specified number of colors will return all of the colors in the palette. This means that for some palettes, the returned list will have a different length than it did in previous versions.
Enhanced color\_palette to accept a parameterized specification of a cubehelix palette in in a string, prefixed with $<$code$>$"ch:"$<$/code$>$ (e.g. $<$code$>$"ch:-.1,.2,l=.7"$<$/code$>$). Note that keyword arguments can be spelled out or referenced using only their first letter. Reversing the palette is accomplished by appending $<$code$>$"\_r"$<$/code$>$, as with other matplotlib colormaps. This specification will be accepted by any seaborn function with a $<$code$>$palette=$<$/code$>$ parameter.
Slightly increased the base font sizes in plotting\_context and increased the scaling factors for $<$code$>$"talk"$<$/code$>$ and $<$code$>$"poster"$<$/code$>$ contexts.
Calling set will now call set\_color\_codes to re-assign the single letter color codes by default

API changes
A few functions have been renamed or have had changes to their default parameters.

The $<$code$>$factorplot$<$/code$>$ function has been renamed to catplot. The new name ditches the original R-inflected terminology to use a name that is more consistent with terminology in pandas and in seaborn itself. This change should hopefully make catplot easier to discover, and it should make more clear what its role is. $<$code$>$factorplot$<$/code$>$ still exists and will pass its arguments through to catplot with a warning. It may be removed eventually, but the transition will be as gradual as possible.
The other reason that the $<$code$>$factorplot$<$/code$>$ name was changed was to ease another alteration which is that the default $<$code$>$kind$<$/code$>$ in catplot is now $<$code$>$"strip"$<$/code$>$ (corresponding to stripplot). This plots a categorical scatter plot which is usually a much better place to start and is more consistent with the default in relplot. The old default style in $<$code$>$factorplot$<$/code$>$ ($<$code$>$"point"$<$/code$>$, corresponding to pointplot) remains available if you want to show a statistical estimation.
The $<$code$>$lvplot$<$/code$>$ function has been renamed to boxenplot. The "letter-value" terminology that was used to name the original kind of plot is obscure, and the abbreviation to $<$code$>$lv$<$/code$>$ did not help anything. The new name should make the plot more discoverable by describing its format (it plots multiple boxes, also known as "boxen"). As with $<$code$>$factorplot$<$/code$>$, the $<$code$>$lvplot$<$/code$>$ function still exists to provide a relatively smooth transition.
Renamed the $<$code$>$size$<$/code$>$ parameter to $<$code$>$height$<$/code$>$ in multi-plot grid objects (FacetGrid, PairGrid, and JointGrid) along with functions that use them ($<$code$>$factorplot$<$/code$>$, lmplot, pairplot, and jointplot) to avoid conflicts with the $<$code$>$size$<$/code$>$ parameter that is used in $<$code$>$scatterplot$<$/code$>$ and $<$code$>$lineplot$<$/code$>$ (necessary to make relplot work) and also makes the meaning of the parameter a bit more clear.
Changed the default diagonal plots in pairplot to use `func`:kdeplot` when a $<$code$>$"hue"$<$/code$>$ dimension is used.
Deprecated the statistical annotation component of JointGrid. The method is still available but will be removed in a future version.
Two older functions that were deprecated in earlier versions, $<$code$>$coefplot$<$/code$>$ and $<$code$>$interactplot$<$/code$>$, have undergone final removal from the code base.

Documentation improvements
There has been some effort put into improving the documentation. The biggest change is that the introduction to the library has been completely rewritten to provide much more information and, critically, examples. In addition to the high-level motivation, the introduction also covers some important topics that are often sources of confusion, like the distinction between figure-level and axes-level functions, how datasets should be formatted for use in seaborn, and how to customize the appearance of the plots.
Other improvements have been made throughout, most notably a thorough re-write of the categorical tutorial categorical\_tutorial.
Other small enhancements and bug fixes

Changed rugplot to plot a matplotlib $<$code$>$LineCollection$<$/code$>$ instead of many $<$code$>$Line2D$<$/code$>$ objects, providing a big speedup for large arrays.
Changed the default off-diagonal plots to use scatterplot. (Note that the $<$code$>$"hue"$<$/code$>$ currently draws three separate scatterplots instead of using the hue semantic of the scatterplot function).
Changed color handling when using kdeplot with two variables. The default colormap for the 2D density now follows the color cycle, and the function can use $<$code$>$color$<$/code$>$ and $<$code$>$label$<$/code$>$ kwargs, adding more flexibility and avoiding a warning when using with multi-plot grids.
Added the $<$code$>$subplot\_kws$<$/code$>$ parameter to PairGrid for more flexibility.
Removed a special case in PairGrid that defaulted to drawing stacked histograms on the diagonal axes.
Fixed jointplot/JointGrid and regplot so that they now accept list inputs.
Fixed a bug in FacetGrid when using a single row/column level or using $<$code$>$col\_wrap=1$<$/code$>$.
Fixed functions that set axis limits so that they preserve auto-scaling state on matplotlib 2.0.
Avoided an error when using matplotlib backends that cannot render a canvas (e.g. PDF).
Changed the install infrastructure to explicitly declare dependencies in a way that $<$code$>$pip$<$/code$>$ is aware of. This means that $<$code$>$pip install seaborn$<$/code$>$ will now work in an empty environment. Additionally, the dependencies are specified with strict minimal versions.
Updated the testing infrastructure to execute tests with pytest (although many individual tests still use nose assertion).},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148\textendash{}156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

  abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression and path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.},

  doi = {10.3847/1538-4357/aad9fb},
  abstract = {Observations of solar coronal loops have identified several common loop characteristics, including that loops appear to cool and have higher than expected densities. Two potential heating scenarios have been suggested to explain these observations. One scenario is that the loops are formed by many strands, each heated independently by a series of small-scale impulsive heating events, or nanoflares. Another hypothesis is that the heating is quasi-steady and highly stratified, i.e., ``footpoint heating''; such heating can drive thermal nonequilibrium in some structures depending on the scale height and magnitude of the energy deposition, and the geometry of the structure. Studies of both types of heating have found that they can qualitatively reproduce the observed loop properties. The goal of this paper is to identify observables that can be used to differentiate between these two heating scenarios. To do this, we use a single loop geometry. For footpoint heating, we vary the heating magnitude and stratification, for impulsive heating, we vary the heating magnitude. We use one-dimensional hydrodynamic codes to calculate the resulting temperature and density evolution. We convolve the temperature and density with the response functions of four EUV channels of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly and one filter channel of Hinode 's X-ray Telescope. We consider two principal diagnostics: the time lag between the appearance of the loop in two different channels, and the ratio of the peak intensities of the loop in the two channels. Based on this limited data set, we find (1) that footpoint heating can predict longer time lags than impulsive heating in some channel pairs, (2) that footpoint heating can predict zero or negative time lags in some channel pairs, (3) that the intensity ratio expected from impulsive heating is confined to a narrow range, while footpoint heating predicts a wider range of intensity ratios, and (4) that the range of temperatures expected in impulsive heating is broader than the range of temperatures expected in footpoint heating. This preliminary study identifies observables that may be useful in discriminating between heating models in future work.},

  abstract = {Much evidence suggests that the solar corona is heated impulsively, meaning that nanoflares may be ubiquitous in quiet and active regions (ARs). Hard X-ray (HXR) observations with unprecedented sensitivity \&gt;3 keV are now enabled by focusing instruments. We analyzed data from the Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager (FOXSI) rocket and the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) spacecraft to constrain properties of AR nanoflares simulated by the EBTEL field-line-averaged hydrodynamics code. We generated model X-ray spectra by computing differential emission measures for homogeneous nanoflare sequences with heating amplitudes H \textsubscript{0}, durations $\tau$, delay times between events t \textsubscript{ N }, and filling factors f. The single quiescent AR observed by FOXSI-2 on 2014 December 11 is well fit by nanoflare sequences with heating amplitudes 0.02 erg cm\textsuperscript{-3} s\textsuperscript{-1} \&lt;H \textsubscript{0} \&lt; 13 erg cm\textsuperscript{-3} s\textsuperscript{-1} and a wide range of delay times and durations. We exclude delays between events shorter than $\sim$900 s at the 90\% confidence level for this region. Three of five regions observed by NuSTAR on 2014 November 1 are well fit by homogeneous nanoflare models, while two regions with higher fluxes are not. Generally, the NuSTAR count spectra are well fit by nanoflare sequences with smaller heating amplitudes, shorter delays, and shorter durations than the allowed FOXSI-2 models. These apparent discrepancies are likely due to differences in spectral coverage between the two instruments and intrinsic differences among the regions. Steady heating (t \textsubscript{ N } = $\tau$) was ruled out with \&gt;99\% confidence for all regions observed by either instrument.},

  abstract = {We investigate intensity variations and energy deposition in five 
coronal loops in active region cores. These were selected for their
strong variability in the AIA/SDO 94 \AA{} intensity channel. We
isolate the hot Fe XVIII and Fe XXI components of the 94 \AA{} and 131
\AA{} by modeling and subtracting the "warm" contributions to the
emission. HMI/SDO data allow us to focus on "inter-moss" regions in the
loops. The detailed evolution of the inter-moss intensity time series
reveals loops that are impulsively heated in a mode compatible with a
nanoflare storm, with a spike in the hot 131 \AA{} signals leading and
the other five EUV emission channels following in progressive cooling
order. A sharp increase in electron temperature tends to follow closely
after the hot 131 \AA{} signal confirming the impulsive nature of the
process. A cooler process of growing emission measure follows more
slowly. The Fourier power spectra of the hot 131 \AA{} signals, when
averaged over the five loops, present three scaling regimes with break
frequencies near 0.1 min-1 and 0.7 min-1. The low
frequency regime corresponds to 1/f noise; the intermediate indicates a
persistent scaling process and the high frequencies show white noise.
Very similar results are found for the energy dissipation in a 2D

representative loop structures that brighten and fade first from X-ray images and subsequently from the EUV images. We determine their lifetime and the delay between their appearance in the different filters. We find that the lifetime in the EUV filters is much longer than expected for a single cooling loop. We also notice that the delay in the loops' appearance in the X-ray and EUV filters is proportional to the loop length. We model one of the loops using a hydrodynamic model with both impulsive and quasi-steady heating functions and find that neither of these simple heating functions can well reproduce the observed loop characteristics in both the X-ray and EUV images. Hence, although this active region is dominated by variable emission and the characteristics of the observed loops are qualitatively consistent with a cooling loop, the timescale of the heating in this active region remains unknown.},

The intensity of these loops implies a density that is as much as 3 orders of magnitude larger than the densities of static solutions to the hydrodynamic equations. It has recently been suggested that these loops are bundles of impulsively heated strands that are cooling through the TRACE passbands. This scenario implies that the loops would appear in the hotter (Fe XV 284 \AA{} or Fe XII 195 \AA{}) TRACE filter images before appearing in the cooler (Fe IX/X 171 \AA{}) TRACE filter images. In this paper, we test this hypothesis by examining the temporal evolution of five active region loops in multiple TRACE EUV filter images. We find that all the loops appear in the hotter filter images before appearing in cooler filter images. We then use the measured delay to estimate a cooling time and find that four of the five loops have lifetimes greater than the expected lifetime of a cooling loop. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that each apparent loop is a bundle of sequentially heated strands; other explanations will also be discussed. To facilitate comparisons between these loops and hydrodynamic simulations, we use a new technique to estimate the loop length and geometry.},

Previous studies have concentrated on cooling the hot plasma by decreasing the coronal heating rate. The difficulty with such models is that when the heating decreases, most of the loop mass is lost by draining onto the chromosphere. It is argued that a prominence condensation is likely to be due to an increase in the heating. The key idea of the model is that the heating increase is spatially dependent so that it is localized nearer to the chromospheric footpoints than to the loop midpoint. Results are presented of numerical simulations of hot loops that are initially heated uniformly, and then undergo heating increases that are concentreated away from the loop midpoint. The temperature at the midpoint first increases, but eventually it collapses to chromospheric values as a result of chromospheric evaporation. Hence, a curious result is obtained, that increasing the heating causes cooling. The resulting densities and time scales agree well with observations. The implications of this model for coronal heating and prominence structure are discussed.},

  abstract = {We analyze coordinated observations of coronal rain in loops, spanning chromospheric, transition region (TR), and coronal temperatures with sub-arcsecond spatial resolution. Coronal rain is found to be a highly multithermal phenomenon with a high degree of co-spatiality in the multi-wavelength emission. EUV darkening and quasi-periodic intensity variations are found to be strongly correlated with coronal rain showers. Progressive cooling of coronal rain is observed, leading to a height dependence of the emission. A fast-slow two-step catastrophic cooling progression is found, which may reflect the transition to optically thick plasma states. The intermittent and clumpy appearance of coronal rain at coronal heights becomes more continuous and persistent at chromospheric heights just before impact, mainly due to a funnel effect from the observed expansion of the magnetic field. Strong density inhomogeneities of 0$\backslash$buildrel\{$\backslash$prime$\backslash$prime\}$\backslash$over\{.\}
2-0$\backslash$buildrel\{$\backslash$prime$\backslash$prime\}$\backslash$over\{.\} 5 are found, in which a transition from temperatures of 105 to 104 K occurs. The 0$\backslash$buildrel\{$\backslash$prime$\backslash$prime\}$\backslash$over\{.\}
2-0$\backslash$buildrel\{$\backslash$prime$\backslash$prime\}$\backslash$over\{.\} 8 width of the distribution of coronal rain is found to be independent of temperature. The sharp increase in the number of clumps at the coolest temperatures, especially at higher resolution, suggests that the bulk distribution of the rain remains undetected. Rain clumps appear organized in strands in both chromospheric and TR temperatures. We further find structure reminiscent of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) thermal mode (also known as entropy mode), thereby suggesting an important role of thermal instability in shaping the basic loop substructure. Rain core densities are estimated to vary between 2 \texttimes{} 1010 and 2.5\texttimes{}

  abstract = {Reported observations in H$\alpha$, Ca II H, and K or other chromospheric lines of coronal rain trace back to the days of the Skylab mission. Corresponding to cool and dense plasma, coronal rain is often observed falling down along coronal loops in active regions. A physical explanation for this spectacular phenomenon has been put forward thanks to numerical simulations of loops with footpoint-concentrated heating, a heating scenario in which cool condensations naturally form in the corona. This effect has been termed "catastrophic cooling" and is the predominant explanation for coronal rain. In this work, we further investigate the link between this phenomenon and the heating mechanisms acting in the corona. We start by analyzing observations of coronal rain at the limb in the Ca II H line performed by the Hinode satellite, and derive interesting statistical properties concerning the dynamics. We then compare the observations with 1.5-dimensional MHD simulations of loops being heated by small-scale discrete events concentrated toward the footpoints (that could come, for instance, from magnetic reconnection events), and by Alfv\'en waves generated at the photospheric level. Both our observation and simulation results suggest that coronal rain is a far more common phenomenon than previously thought. Also, we show that the structure and dynamics of condensations are far more sensitive to the internal pressure changes in loops than to gravity. Furthermore, it is found that if a loop is predominantly heated from Alfv\'en waves, coronal rain is inhibited due to the characteristic uniform heating they produce. Hence, coronal rain may not only point to the spatial distribution of the heating in coronal loops but also to the agent of the heating itself. We thus propose coronal rain as a marker for coronal heating mechanisms.},

SPP's main science goal is to determine the structure and dynamics of the Sun's coronal magnetic field, understand how the solar corona and wind are heated and accelerated, and determine what processes accelerate energetic particles. Understanding these fundamental phenomena has been a top-priority science goal for over five decades, dating back to the 1958 Simpson Committee Report. The scale and concept of such a mission has been revised at intervals since that time, yet the core has always been a close encounter with the Sun. The mission design and the technology and engineering developments enable SPP to meet its science objectives to: (1) Trace the flow of energy that heats and accelerates the solar corona and solar wind; (2) Determine the structure and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the solar wind; and (3) Explore mechanisms that accelerate and transport energetic particles. The SPP mission was confirmed in March 2014 and is under development as a part of NASA's Living with a Star (LWS) Program. SPP is scheduled for launch in mid-2018, and will perform 24 orbits over a 7-year nominal mission duration. Seven Venus gravity assists gradually reduce SPP's perihelion from 35 solar radii ($\mathsl{R}\mathsl{S}$RSR\_\{S\}) for the first orbit to $<$10 $\mathsl{R}\mathsl{S}<$10 RS\{$<$\}10\textasciitilde{}R\_\{S\} for the final three orbits.

In the present paper the modifications required for similar calculations on positive ions are discussed, and cross-sections are calculated for electron excitation of the ground configuration terms of N II, O II, O III, Ne III and S II. These cross-sections are of fundamental importance in discussing the physical state and chemical composition of gaseous nebulae. A first approximation to the solution of the coupled integro-differential equations is obtained by neglecting energy differences (the E.R. approximation). A comparison is made between the cross-sections calculated using exact solutions of the E.R. equations and using weak coupling approximations to these solutions. It is found that, although allowance for distortion gives a considerable improvement, the weak coupling approximations cannot in general be relied upon to give accurate results. Estimates of the magnitudes of the terms omitted in the E.R. approximation are made by perturbation methods, and in all cases these terms are found to be reasonably small. Final values for the cross-sections are probably correct to within $\pm$ 40\% in absolute value and rather more accurate than this in the relative values. Cross-sections estimated for a number of other ions of astrophysical interest are considered to be correct to within a factor of 2. Hartree-Fock wave functions for N II are given in an appendix.},

  doi = {10.1088/2041-8205/791/2/L31},
  abstract = {There have been several ideas proposed to explain how the Sun's corona is heated and how the solar wind is accelerated. Some models assume that open magnetic field lines are heated by Alfv\'en waves driven by photospheric motions and dissipated after undergoing a turbulent cascade. Other models posit that much of the solar wind's mass and energy is injected via magnetic reconnection from closed coronal loops. The latter idea is motivated by observations of reconnecting jets and also by similarities of ion composition between closed loops and the slow wind. Wave/turbulence models have also succeeded in reproducing observed trends in ion composition signatures versus wind speed. However, the absolute values of the charge-state ratios predicted by those models tended to be too low in comparison with observations. This Letter refines these predictions by taking better account of weak Coulomb collisions for coronal electrons, whose thermodynamic properties determine the ion charge states in the low corona. A perturbative description of nonlocal electron transport is applied to an existing set of wave/turbulence models. The resulting electron velocity distributions in the low corona exhibit mild suprathermal tails characterized by "kappa" exponents between 10 and 25. These suprathermal electrons are found to be sufficiently energetic to enhance the charge states of oxygen ions, while maintaining the same relative trend with wind speed that was found when the distribution was assumed to be Maxwellian. The updated wave/turbulence models are in excellent agreement with solar wind ion composition measurements.},

  abstract = {Aims: The solar transition region satisfies the conditions for appearance of the non-thermal $\kappa$-distribution. We aim to prove the occurrence of the non-thermal $\kappa$-distribution in the solar transition region and diagnose its parameters. \\
 Methods: The intensity ratios of Si iii lines observed by SUMER in 1100-1320 \AA{} region do not correspond to the line ratios computed under the assumption of the Maxwellian electron distribution. We computed a set of synthetic Si iii spectra for the electron $\kappa$-distributions with different values of the parameter $\kappa$. We had to include the radiation field in our calculations to explain the observed line ratios. We propose diagnostics of the parameter $\kappa$ and other plasma parameters and analyze the effect of the different gradient of differential emission measures (DEM) on the presented calculations. \\
 Results: The used line ratios are sensitive to T, density and the parameter $\kappa$. All these parameters were determined from the SUMER observations for the coronal hole (CH), quiet Sun (QS) and active region (AR) using our proposed diagnostics. A strong gradient of DEM influences the diagnosed parameters of plasma. The essential contributions to the total line intensities do not correspond to single T but a wider range of T, and they originate in different atmospheric layers. The amount of the contributions from these atmospheric layers depends on the gradient of DEM and the shape of the electron distribution function. \\
 Conclusions: The $\kappa$-distribution is able to explain the observed Si iii line spectrum in the transition region. The degree of non-thermality increases with the activity of the solar region, it is lower for CH and higher for the AR. The DEM influences the diagnosed T and N\textsubscript{e} but it has only little effect on the diagnostics of the parameter $\kappa$.},

  abstract = {It is proposed that the pervasive redshift observed in transition region spectral lines is caused by downward propagating acoustic waves. The dynamic response of a coronal loop to energy released as heat near the loop apex is examined by solving the hydrodynamic equations numerically, consistently including the effects of nonequilibrium ionization on the radiative losses and on the internal energy. It is found that the radiative loss curve may change by a factor of 2 during the loop evolution as a result of flows and waves. A simple analytical analysis is performed to isolate the physical effects relevant to the line formation process. The amplitude of the line shift is found to depend on the characteristic time scale for ionization of the radiating ion as well as the global loop parameters, the time scales for loop cooling, the maximum temperature, and the base pressure.},

  abstract = {In the work described here we investigate atomic processes leading to the formation of emission lines within the IRIS wavelength range at temperatures near \$10\^5\$\textasciitilde{}K. We focus on (1) non-equilibrium and (2) density-dependent effects influencing the formation and radiative properties of S IV and O IV. These two effects have significant impacts on spectroscopic diagnostic measurements of quantities associated with the plasma that emission lines from S IV and O IV provide. We demonstrate this by examining nanoflare-based coronal heating to determine what the detectable signatures are in transition region emission. A detailed comparison between predictions from numerical experiments and several sets of observational data is presented to show how one can ascertain when non-equilibrium ionization and/or density-dependent atomic processes are important for diagnosing nanoflare properties, the magnitude of their contribution, and what information can be reliably extracted from the spectral data. Our key findings are the following. (1) The S/O intensity ratio is a powerful diagnostic of non-equilibrium ionization. (2) Non-equilibrium ionization has a strong effect on the observed line intensities even in the case of relatively weak nanoflare heating. (3) The density-dependence of atomic rate coefficients is only important when the ion population is out of equilibrium. (4) In the sample of active regions we examined, weak nanoflares coupled with non-equilibrium ionization and density-dependent atomic rates were required to explain the observed properties (e.g. the S/O intensity ratios). (5) Enhanced S/O intensity ratios cannot be due solely to the heating strength and must depend on other processes (e.g. heating frequency, non-Maxwellian distributions).},

Our model utilizes differential emission measure distributions derived from spatially and spectrally resolved solar observations, full-disk solar images, and a database of atomic physics parameters to calculate the solar EUV irradiance. In this paper we present a new solar minimum irradiance spectrum for wavelengths below 1200 \AA. This spectrum is based on extensive observations of the
quiet Sun taken with the CDS and SUMER spectrometers on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and the most recent version of the CHIANTI atomic physics database. In general, we find excellent agreement between this new irradiance spectrum and our previous quiet-Sun
reference spectrum derived primarily from Harvard Skylab observations. Our analysis does show that the quiet-Sun emission measure above about 1 MK declines more rapidly than in our earlier emission measure
distribution and that the intensities of the EUV free-bound continua at some wavelengths are somewhat smaller than indicated by the Harvard observations. Our new reference spectrum is also generally consistent with recent irradiance observations taken near solar minimum. There are, however, two areas of persistent disagreement. Our solar spectrum indicates that the irradiance measurements overestimate the contribution of the EUV free-bound continua at some wavelengths by as much as a factor of 10. Our model also cannot reproduce the observed irradiances at wavelengths below about 150 \AA. Comparisons with spectrally
resolved solar and stellar observations indicate that only a small fraction of the emission lines in the 60-120 \AA{} wavelength range
are accounted for in CHIANTI.},

  annote = {We discuss the problem of determining plasma structure from optically thin emission lines whose emission coefficients and frequency-integrated intensities are dependent on temperature T and electron density n. We cast the problem into the inverse form discussed by Hubeny \& Judge (1995). Three properties of the kernels in the integral equations lead to fundamental limitations in trying to determine the source term $\mu$(T, n), the ``emission measure differential in temperature and density,'' from a set of emission-line intensities. First, the kernels are rather weakly dependent on n. Second, they have asymptotically identical dependencies on n. The inverse problem is therefore very poorly conditioned in the density dimension. Third, the kernels cannot (and may never) be calculated with an accuracy better than $\pm$10\%. These properties set limits on the accuracy of all solutions, independent of the accuracy of observed line intensities. This concurs with earlier but less general work by Brown et al. (1991). We try to determine solutions for $\mu$(T, n), using specific target sources and numerical algorithms. Using realistic uncertainties, calculations indicate that meaningful inverse solutions for $\mu$(T, n) cannot be obtained owing to the severe propagation of kernel errors, irrespective of the quality of observational data. Solutions for the ``emission measure differential in temperature'' $\xi$(T) = $\int$ $\mu$(T, n)dn are more robust against instabilities driven by poor conditioning. Since traditional ``emission-line diagnostic ratios'' can only be defined through $\mu$(T, n) (or some generalization thereof), our analysis casts doubt on the meaning of plasma properties derived from such line ratios, and illustrates the severe nonuniqueness of any equivalent ``inverse'' solution. This work may be important for studying a wide variety of atomic and ionic emission-line spectra, including work with instruments on SOHO and the Hubble Space Telescope.}

Our data consist of (1) daily averaged UV irradiances from the SOLSTICE on the UARS spacecraft and (2) EUV irradiances obtained on the same date from a m spectrograph flown on a sounding rocket. Both instruments have a spectral resolution of roughly 1 \AA. The absolute uncertainties in these data are at most $\pm$15\% ( $\pm$ 2 $\sigma$), one of the highest photometric accuracies yet achieved. We find large, highly significant and systematic discrepancies in the emission measure analysis of transition region lines which can only be accounted for by a breakdown of one or more standard assumptions. All strong lines above 1000 \AA, which are from the Li and Na isoelectronic sequences, are too strong by factors of between 2.5 and 7 compared with their counterparts in the EUV region. Previous studies were tantalizingly close to finding these discrepancies, but those data lacked the wavelength coverage and relative photometric precision necessary for definitive conclusions. We argue that either dynamical effects, inaccurate treatments of atomic processes, and/or Lyman continuum absorption are the culprits. However, we favor the former explanation. In any event, this study should have implications for models of the solar transition region, for observing programs with the CDS and SUMER instruments on SOHO, and for analysis of UV spectra for stars across the cool half of the H-R diagram. Finally, the discrepancy is not seen for the ``coronal'' Li-like ions.}

  abstract = {The problem of deriving the temperature distribution in hot optically thin plasmas from their X-ray spectra is discussed, and it is argued that X-ray spectral data are fundamentally insensitive to the thermal structure of the source, regardless of the spectral resolution of the observations. The problem is formulated in terms of the integral equation which relates both line and continuous spectra to the differential emission measure of the source. The mathematical difficulties underlying the solution of such integral equations are outlined, emphasizing the key role of the kernel function. Continuous bremsstrahlung spectra are considered, and it is shown that the kernel involved (the Laplace transform) is highly unstable to small perturbations in the spectrum due to the flatness of the kernel function. The line-spectrum problem is examined, and gross errors in the solution are shown to result from very small observational errors. A specific example for solar active regions demonstrates that most existing models for the differential emission measure are likely to be spurious. Suggestions are made for the most realistic and economic approach to analysis of existing spectra as well as for designs of future spectrometers.},

In a set of 149 M- and X-class flares observed during the first two years of the SDO mission, AIA finds DEM peak temperatures at the time of the peak GOES 1 \textendash{} 8 \AA{} flux to have an average of T p=12.0$\pm$2.9 MK and Gaussian DEM widths of log10($\sigma$ T )=0.50$\pm$0.13. From GOES observations of the same 149 events, a mean temperature of T p=15.6$\pm$2.4 MK is inferred, which is systematically higher by a factor of T GOES/T AIA=1.4$\pm$0.4. We demonstrate that this discrepancy results from the isothermal assumption in the inversion of the GOES filter ratio. From isothermal fits to photon spectra at energies of $\epsilon\approx$6 \textendash{} 12 keV of 61 of these events, RHESSI finds the temperature to be higher still by a factor of T RHESSI/T AIA=1.9$\pm$1.0. We find that this is partly a consequence of the isothermal assumption. However, RHESSI is not sensitive to the low-temperature range of the DEM peak, and thus RHESSI samples only the high-temperature tail of the DEM function. This can also contribute to the discrepancy between AIA and RHESSI temperatures. The higher flare temperatures found by GOES and RHESSI imply correspondingly lower emission measures. We conclude that self-consistent flare DEM temperatures and emission measures require simultaneous fitting of EUV (AIA) and soft X-ray (GOES and RHESSI) fluxes.},

In this paper we describe a method for computing the differential emission measure distribution in a flare using EVE observations and apply it to several representative events. We find that in all phases of the flare the differential emission measure distribution is broad. Comparisons of EVE spectra with calculations based on parameters derived from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites soft X-ray fluxes indicate that the isothermal approximation is generally a poor representation of the thermal structure of a flare.}

We have validated the new technique on artificial test data, and apply it to two X-class flares from solar cycle 24 to determine the flare DEM and its temporal evolution; the constraints on the thermal emission derived from the EVE data also constrain the low energy cutoff of the non-thermal electrons, a crucial parameter for flare energetics.

This allows a systematic exploration of the parameter space, and using a statistical approach the respective probabilities of all the DEMs compatible with the uncertainties can be computed. Following this methodology, several important properties of the DEM inversion, including new limitations, can be derived and presented in a very synthetic fashion. In this first paper, we describe the formalism and we focus on isothermal plasmas as building blocks to understand the more complex DEMs studied in the second paper. The behavior of the inversion of AIA data being thus quantified, and we provide new tools to properly interpret the DEM. We quantify the improvement of the isothermal inversion with six AIA bands compared to previous EUV imagers. The maximum temperature resolution of AIA is found to be 0.03 log Te , and we derive a rigorous test to quantify the compatibility of observations with the isothermal hypothesis. However, we demonstrate limitations in the ability of AIA alone to distinguish different physical conditions.}

Ratios of emission lines, for example, can be used to infer the electron density of the emitting plasma. Similarly, the relative intensities of emission lines formed over a wide range of temperatures yield information on the temperature structure. A critical component of this analysis is understanding how uncertainties in the underlying atomic physics propagate to the uncertainties in the inferred plasma parameters. At present, however, atomic physics databases do not include uncertainties on the atomic parameters and there is no established methodology for using them even if they did. In this paper we develop simple models for uncertainties in the collision strengths and decay rates for Fe XIII and apply them to the interpretation of density-sensitive lines observed with the EUV (extreme ultraviolet) Imagining spectrometer (EIS) on Hinode. We incorporate these uncertainties in a Bayesian framework. We consider both a pragmatic Bayesian method where the atomic physics information is unaffected by the observed data, and a fully Bayesian method where the data can be used to probe the physics. The former generally increases the uncertainty in the inferred density by about a factor of 5 compared with models that incorporate only statistical uncertainties. The latter reduces the uncertainties on the inferred densities, but identifies areas of possible systematic problems with either the atomic physics or the observed intensities.},

The models obtained are characterized by very steep temperature gradients. The relative intensities of emission lines in the disk and limb spectra have enabled the height of the emitting regions to be determined independently of the above assumptions, and independently of atomic data and absolute intensities. A comparison is made of the structure found by the two methods, and within the accuracy of the present data these are consistent. Emission from low temperature ( \textasciitilde{} 10 4 K) material is observed from heights up to 10 4 km above the transition region, and this probably originates in spicules.},

  abstract = {We consider three recent large-scale calculations for the radiative and electron-impact excitation data of N IV, carried out with different methods and codes. The scattering calculations employed the relativistic Dirac \$R\$-matrix (DARC) method, the intermediate coupling frame transformation (ICFT) \$R\$-matrix method, and the B-spline \$R\$-matrix (BSR) method. These are all large-scale scattering calculations with well-tested and sophisticated codes, which use the same set of target states. One concern raised in previous literature is related to the increasingly large discrepancies in the effective collision strengths between the three sets of calculations for increasingly weak and/or high-lying transitions. We have built three model ions and calculated the intensities of all the main spectral lines in this ion. We have found that, despite such large differences, excellent agreement (to within \$$\backslash$pm\$\textasciitilde{}20$\backslash$\%) exists between all the spectroscopically-relevant line intensities. This provides confidence in the reliability of the calculations for plasma diagnostics. We have used the differences in the radiative and excitation rates amongst the three sets of calculations to obtain a measure of the uncertainty in each rate. Using a Monte Carlo approach, we have shown how these uncertainties affect the main theoretical ratios which are used to measure electron densities and temperatures.},

order-of-magnitude scalings, this result accounts for the effect of the evolution of the loop plasma parameters on the cooling time. When the conductive cooling leads to an 'evaporation' of chromospheric material, the cooling time scales L5/6/p1/6, where the coronal phase (defined as the time maximum temperature). When the conductive cooling is static, the cooling time scales as
L3/4n1/4. In deriving these results, use was made of an important scaling law (T proportional to n2) during the radiative cooling phase that was forst noted in one-dimensional
hydrodynamic numerical simulations (Serio et al. 1991; Jakimiec et al. 1992). Our own simulations show that this result is restricted to approximately the radiative loss function of Rosner, Tucker, \&
Vaiana (1978). for different radiative loss functions, other scaling result, with T and n scaling almost linearly when the radiative loss falls off as T-2. It is shown that these scaling laws are part of a class of analytic solutions developed by Antiocos (1980).},

  abstract = {Coronal active regions are observed to get increasingly fuzzy (i.e., increasingly confused and uniform) in increasingly hard energy bands or lines. We explain this as evidence of fine multi-temperature structure of coronal loops. To this end, we model bundles of loops made of thin strands, each heated by short and intense heat pulses. For simplicity, we assume that the heat pulses are all equal and triggered only once in each strand at a random time. The pulse intensity and cadence are selected so as to have steady active region loops (\textasciitilde{}3 MK) on average. We compute the evolution of the confined heated plasma with a hydrodynamic loop model. We then compute the emission along each strand in several spectral lines, from cool (\&lt;=1 MK), to warm (2-3 MK) lines, detectable with Hinode/Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer, to hot X-ray lines. The strands are then put side by side to construct an active region loop bundle. We find that in the warm lines (2-3 MK) the loop emission fills all the available image surface. Therefore, the emission appears quite uniform and it is difficult to resolve the single loops, while in the cool lines the loops are considerably more contrasted and the region is less fuzzy. The main reasons for this effect are that, during their evolution, i.e., pulse heating and slow cooling, each strand spends a relatively long time at temperatures around 2-3 MK and it has a high emission measure during that phase, so the whole region appears more uniform or smudged. We predict that fuzziness should be reduced in the hot UV and X-ray lines.},

No significant time variation or field dependence is found for the period of the observations, at least to the accuracy of the calculated means (variance of from about 2 m/sec at low latitudes to about 10 m/sec near the poles). The rotation function omega at solar latitude phi is shown to be 2.902 0.464 sin sq phi - 0.328 sin to the 4th phi microrad/sec, in agreement with the Mt.

  abstract = {NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) spacecraft was launched 11 February 2010 with three instruments onboard, including the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI). After commissioning, HMI began normal operations on 1 May 2010 and has subsequently observed the Sun's entire visible disk almost continuously. HMI collects sequences of polarized filtergrams taken at a fixed cadence with two 4096 \texttimes{} 4096 cameras, from which are computed arcsecond-resolution maps of photospheric observables that include line-of-sight velocity and magnetic field, continuum intensity, line width, line depth, and the Stokes polarization parameters [I, Q, U, V]. Two processing pipelines have been implemented at the SDO Joint Science Operations Center (JSOC) at Stanford University to compute these observables from calibrated Level-1 filtergrams, one that computes line-of-sight quantities every 45 seconds and the other, primarily for the vector magnetic field, that computes averages on a 720-second cadence. Corrections are made for static and temporally changing CCD characteristics, bad pixels, image alignment and distortion, polarization irregularities, filter-element uncertainty and nonuniformity, as well as Sun-spacecraft velocity. We detail the functioning of these two pipelines, explain known issues affecting the measurements of the resulting physical quantities, and describe how regular updates to the instrument calibration impact them. We also describe how the scheme for computing the observables is optimized for actual HMI observations. Initial calibration of HMI was performed on the ground using a variety of light sources and calibration sequences. During the five years of the SDO prime mission, regular calibration sequences have been taken on orbit to improve and regularly update the instrument calibration, and to monitor changes in the HMI instrument. This has resulted in several changes in the observables processing that are detailed here. The instrument more than satisfies all of the original specifications for data quality and continuity. The procedures described here still have significant room for improvement. The most significant remaining systematic errors are associated with the spacecraft orbital velocity.},

Usually, solar active regions that produce large flares will also produce a CME, but this is not always true. Despite advances in numerical modeling, it is still unclear which circumstances will produce a CME. Therefore, it is worthwhile to empirically determine which features distinguish flares associated with CMEs from flares that are not. At this time, no
extensive study has used physically meaningful features of active regions to distinguish between these two populations. As such, we attempt to do so by using features derived from (1) photospheric vector magnetic field data taken by the Solar Dynamics Observatory's
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager instrument and (2) X-ray flux data from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite's X-ray Flux instrument. We build a catalog of active regions that either produced both a flare and a CME (the positive class) or simply a flare (the negative class). We then use machine-learning algorithms to (1)
determine which features distinguish these two populations, and (2) forecast whether an active region that produces an M- or X-class flare will also produce a CME. We compute the True Skill Statistic, a forecast verification metric, and find that it is a relatively high value of $\sim$0.8 $\pm$ 0.2. We conclude that a combination of six parameters,
which are all intensive in nature, will capture most of the relevant information contained in the photospheric magnetic field.},

constraining the coronal heating mechanism. Observations of "warm"
coronal loops (\textasciitilde{}1 MK) have indicated that the heating is impulsive and
that coronal plasma is far from equilibrium. In contrast, observations
at higher temperatures (\textasciitilde{}3 MK) have generally been consistent with
steady heating models. Previous observations, however, have not been
able to exclude the possibility that the high temperature loops are
actually composed of many small-scale threads that are in various stages
of heating and cooling and only appear to be in equilibrium. With new
observations from the EUV Imaging Spectrometer and X-ray Telescope (XRT)
on Hinode we have the ability to investigate the properties of high
temperature coronal plasma in extraordinary detail. We examine the
emission in the core of an active region and find three independent
lines of evidence for steady heating. We find that the emission observed
in XRT is generally steady for hours, with a fluctuation level of
approximately 15\% in an individual pixel. Short-lived impulsive heating
events are observed, but they appear to be unrelated to the steady
emission that dominates the active region. Furthermore, we find no
evidence for warm emission that is spatially correlated with the hot
emission, as would be expected if the high temperature loops are the
result of impulsive heating. Finally, we also find that intensities in
the "moss," the footpoints of high temperature loops, are consistent
with steady heating models provided that we account for the local
expansion of the loop from the base of the transition region to the
corona. In combination, these results provide strong evidence that the
heating in the core of an active region is effectively steady, that is,
the time between heating events is short relative to the relevant
radiative and conductive cooling times.},

measurements are derived from spectral profiles of the Fe XII 195
\AA{} line. Using the 2'' slit, we repeatedly scanned 150'' by 150''
in a few minutes. This is the first time it has been possible to make
such velocity measurements in the moss, and the data presented are the
highest cadence spatially resolved maps of moss Doppler and nonthermal
velocities ever obtained in the corona. The observed region produced
numerous C- and M-class flares with several occurring in the core close
to the moss. The magnetic field was therefore clearly changing in the
active region core, so we ought to be able to detect dynamic signatures
in the moss if they exist. Our measurements of moss intensities agree
with previous studies in that a less than 15\% variability is seen over a
period of 16 hr. Our new measurements of Doppler and nonthermal
velocities reveal no strong flows or motions in the moss, nor any
significant variability in these quantities. The results confirm that
moss at the bases of high temperature coronal loops is heated
quasi-steadily. They also show that quasi-steady heating can contribute
significantly even in the core of a flare productive active region. Such
heating may be impulsive at high frequency, but if so it does not give
rise to large flows or motions.},

ingredient in modeling confined plasma in the solar corona. Spectral
models are continuously updated to include the emission from more
spectral lines, with significant effects on radiative losses, especially
around 1 MK. Aims: We investigate the effect of changes to the
radiative-loss temperature dependence caused by upgrading spectral codes
on the predictions obtained when modeling confined plasma in the solar
corona. Methods: We revisit the hydrodynamic simulation of a
pulse-heated loop strand by comparing results obtained using an old and
a recent radiative-loss function. Results: We find that
significant changes occur in the plasma evolution during the late phases
of plasma cooling: when the more recent radiative-loss curve is used,
the plasma cooling rate indeed increases significantly when temperatures
reach 1-2 MK. This more rapid cooling occurs when the plasma density is
higher than a threshold value, which in impulsive heating models leads
to the loop plasma becoming overdense. This rapid cooling has the effect
of steepening the slope in the emission measure distribution of coronal
plasmas with temperature, at temperatures lower than \textasciitilde{}2 MK, and of
reducing the visibility of warm (1 MK) loops. Conclusions: The
effects of changes to the radiative-loss curves can be important when
modeling the late phases of the evolution of pulse-heated coronal loops,
and, in general, of thermally unstable optically thin plasmas.},

The integral number of events varies approximately as the inverse of the peak flux, down to the limits of the measurements. These observations suggest that even very small transient releases of energy by the sun may be primarily nonthermal in character.

We show that the influence is significant on the flaring plasma dynamics as well as on the relevant spectra, when the flare heating is mostly delivered either at the loop apex or by means of low-energy-cutoff nonthermal electron beams. For base-heated loop flares, instead, the effect of viscosity is significant only with very intense heating.

  abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of the chromosphere is crucial to understanding energy transport across the solar atmosphere. The chromosphere is optically thick at many wavelengths and described by non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE), making it difficult to interpret observations. Furthermore, there is considerable evidence that the atmosphere is filamented, and that current instruments do not resolve small-scale features. In flares, it is likely that multithreaded models are required to describe the heating. The combination of NLTE effects and multithreaded modeling requires computationally demanding calculations, which has motivated the development of a model that can efficiently treat both. We describe the implementation of a solver in a hydrodynamic code for the hydrogen level populations that approximates the NLTE solutions. We derive an accurate electron density across the atmosphere that includes the effects of nonequilibrium ionization for helium and metals. We show the effects on hydrodynamic simulations, which are used to synthesize light curves using a postprocessing radiative transfer code. We demonstrate the utility of this model on IRIS observations of a small flare. We show that the Doppler shifts in Mg ii, C ii, and O i can be explained with a multithreaded model of loops subjected to electron beam heating, so long as NLTE effects are treated. The intensities, however, do not match the observed values very well, which is due to assumptions about the initial atmosphere. We briefly show how altering the initial atmosphere can drastically alter line profiles and derived quantities and suggest that it should be tuned to preflare observations.},

resolved (if \{w\}p/\{\{$\Delta$ \}\}x$\greaterequivlnt$ 2.7). For images with

images but are fully resolved in Hi-C images, where our model predicts a
most frequent (peak) value at \{w\}p$\approx$ 550 \{km\}, in agreement
